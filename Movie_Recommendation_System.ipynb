       "[['When \"Moana\" learns that the whole of Pacific Island society is under a curse from the powerful god \"Nalo\", she has to recruit a few faithful crew members and go seek out \"Maui\" before she can find the long lost and sunken island of \"Morefutu\". Once there, she hopes to break the malevolent force that has, for centuries, ensured that her people never manage to make contact with any others - despite her finding evidence that they did exist - somewhere, once upon a time! Of course there\\'s \"Heihei\" the chicken and \"Pua\" the pig, but she\\'s gonna need more help than that so up steps pin-up \"Moni\", the knife-wielding engineer \"Loto\" and the glass-half-empty farmer \"Keke\" and off they go. Loads of escapades await them as they again encounter their poisoned-dart firing coconut warriors - the \"Kakamora\", a giant clam and, of course, the winds and the seas as the mischievous \"Matangi\" and her army of bats tries to make life as difficult as they can. Luckily, \"Matangi\" has also had a run-in with \"Maui\" and so maybe they can all unite now, but can his giant hook and his tattoos empower him to help her to defeat their powerful nemesis? Well, what do you think? Thing is, we\\'re not watching this for any jeopardy or menace from the storyline, we are watching it for the fun characterisations and the engaging dynamic between the eponymous girl and her super-strength demigod. That, sadly, is sadly lacking in this disappointing sequel. The visual effects are super, and the pace of the adventure likewise - but the story is just too thin and the arrival of the new characters doesn\\'t really compensate as it rather procedurally, if colourfully, meanders along without really delving into and exploiting the fantastic depths of culture and mythology at it\\'s disposal. The soundtrack is also nowhere near as catchy, and even though some of the lyrics are quite entertaining, the film lacks a killer song for either leading character. Sure, we\\'ve the power ballad \"Beyond\" and \"Maui\" gets the quirky \"Can I Get a Chee Chee\", but they lack the charming silliness of Lin Manuel Miranda\\'s efforts from eight years ago. It\\'s all perfectly watchable, and ought to be seen on a big screen to show off the creatively detailed animation, but I reckon it\\'s entirely forgettable and will probably just serve as a stepping stone to the next one which is certain to follow just as seagulls follow fishing boats.',\n",

       " ['Amaran is a moving tribute to Major Mukund Varadarajan and it’s a commercial action film that was wonderfully progressed with an emotional touch. The movie where Sivakarthikeyan and Sai Pallavi lead the cast points towards the struggles of soldiers and their families and the main focus is on ‘Mukund’s wife ‘Indhu.’\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom the time I watched Amaran, I noticed the real emotions put into this movie, but equally Sai Pallavi. The movements through the lens embraced the tidewater essence of Kashmir and sharpened the film’s lovers’ themes of the price of love. They did not make me feel like I was doing something I can usually do with the movies I watch at home or even with the games I play on my PlayStation., but the emotional story of the film kept me glued to my seat.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnder all these facts, one can note that Amaran successfully maintains respect and honor towards the main hero and reveals an interesting story that keeps the viewer engaged after the end of the film.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you liked my experience, then check out the <a href=\"https://moviepoptime.com/action/amaran/\" target=\"_blank\">Latest Movie Reviews</a>.'],\n",
       " [\"<em>'Captain America: Brave New World'</em> came close to pleasing me, but in the end I think it is not consistently enjoyable enough to be classed as something I'd want to watch again and/or recommend. There is quite a bit about it that I did like, but the down moments hurt the ups.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe cast and their characters are positives. I'm a big fan of Anthony Mackie's as he has done many roles in films that I've highly, highly enjoyed; interestingly, he has appeared in three of the fourteen films I've given a total 10/10 to. Here, he is very good in the titular part.\\r\\n\\r\\nI'm not someone overly attached to Marvel and therefore Chris Evans' Captain America, so this new era doesn't hinder my interest in the lead character. I'm admittedly not wholly convinced Mackie is undoubtedly a perfect fit for the role, though his performance itself is perfectly watchable and fun enough.\\r\\n\\r\\nCarl Lumbly's performance as Isaiah is great in this, he genuinely made me care quite a bit about Bradley; especially in the more emotive scenes. Danny Ramirez, Harrison Ford, Giancarlo Esposito (a little typecast still, sadly) and Tim Blake Nelson (albeit the weakest) are also pluses that I have for this movie.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy main issues lie with the plot and how it is told. There were too many moments where I could feel myself losing interest in events onscreen, most notably across the first half. The second half is better paced, if still not making for superb viewing. I was firmly awaiting the credits, which is never a good sign.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I was locked on to the story, I did dig it. I particularly found the interactions/dynamics between characters to be solid, for example Cap with Carl, Joaquin and Seth. I just think what lets this down, unfortunately to a somewhat damaging degree, is that the plot just isn't quite good enough. A shorter run time (even though it isn't that long) may have helped, but I'm not sure.\\r\\n\\r\\nI just realised that this is the first MCU film that I've scored below 7/10. That feels harsh, it isn't as bad as that sounds at all, but thinking about this and the other flicks from the franchise that I've rated similarly it is actually merited. <em>'The Incredible Hulk'</em> and <em>'Ant-Man and the Wasp'</em> were my bottom two, both are better films.\",\n",
       "  '“Brave New World” but same old yarn, sadly. Morgan Freeman clearly didn’t fancy this one so Marvel have resurrected another ex-president in Harrison Ford to put together a treaty that will deliver the old save the globe type of thing. It’s all about this giant hand-shaped structure that has emerged from the ocean and that contains “adamantium” - and that’s even more indestructible than “Vibranium” (how can something be more indestructible?). Anyway, before this accord can get signed off by a curious quadrumvirate of the USA, India, France and China a shipment of this new material gets pinched and it’s down to “Capt. America” (Anthony Mackie) and his new sidekick “Torres/Falcon” (Danny Ramirez) to retrieve it. Loads of end-to-end fisticuffs later and the goods are secure which earns our dynamic duo and their inspirational trainer “Bradley” (Carl Lumbly) an invitation to the White House. That’s where the wheels really do come off as their pal starts taking potshots at the President and we discover that the erstwhile somewhat militaristic and temperamental “Ross” and “Cap” aren’t exactly on the same page. It’s pretty obvious that there’s a third party pulling the strings so it’s going to need all of his patience and guile if the shielded wonder is to retrieve his mentor from solitary, rebuild his relationship with his president before that man really sees red, and also get to the bottom of a dastardly scheme that seems bent on causing international strife between the USA and Japan. Mackie’s a charismatic man and he does what he can with this, but the story comes across as little more than an hybrid of “Top Gun” (1986) meets “Tomorrow Never Dies” (1997) with an unremarkable cast, including Ford’s “Ross”, that struggles to make any impact as it races along for two hours without presenting anything original or particularly entertaining. It passes the time, but is yet another bland offering from a studio that is increasingly resorting to it’s creative technicians to design something that looks great but resonates not remotely.

Our eponymous blue hedgehog, his best pals \"Tails\" and \"Knuckles\" have settled down to a peaceable life with \"Tom\" (James Marsden) and \"Maddie\" (Tika Sumpter) but realise they have to rise to the occasion so off they go.

Some of the writing is quite fun, with plenty of contemporary and quite sarcastic references to raise a smile, and there are homages paid aplenty to just about everyone from \"007\" and the \"Fantastic Four\" to the \"Avengers\" - but in the end it\\'s all just a little too shiny and predicable.

I will say the white ones look a bit iffy, but that's nothing even close to a big issue.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe voice cast are all perfectly good. Aaron Pierre, Kelvin Harrison Jr. (only now realising his character wasn't called Tucker... bit embarrassing on my part), John Kani et al. all merit props. The standouts for me, however, are Mads Mikkelsen and Lennie James - two actors I do love watching (or listening to, in this case), admittedly.\\r\\n\\r\\nMusic-wise, it's not the strongest - I can't recall any of the songs, to be honest. That's not actually a terrible thing though, as it means none of the musical numbers grated on me either - and that's always a win in my books. Elsewhere, Timon & Pumbaa are unamusing and wasted, but at the same time are unnecessarily forced into this prequel/sequel.\\r\\n\\r\\nObviously, this still falls far adrift of the beloved original animated film.

The pair prove inseparable as they grow up, but the encroachment of a pride of angry white lions led by \"Kiros\" soon threatens their peaceful lives and forces the two to flee in search of a mystical land. Along the way they encounter the wily lioness \"Sarabi\" and her airborne early warning system \"Zazu\" and joining forces, have their work cut out for them crossing the snowy mountains.

The sequel captures the original's essence while introducing elements, making it a worthy successor.\\r\\n\\r\\nPaul Mescal in the lead role - inherited from the ever-growling Russel Crowe, who was at the top of his career in the original - holds his ground against Denzel Washington, whose charisma cleaves through the screen as effortlessly as his character's sword.\\r\\n\\r\\nRidley Scott admits he was prompted to revisit _Gladiator_ by the acclaim he received from those too young to have seen the original on the big screen.

       "  \"<em>'Gladiator II'</em> is awesome!\\r\\n\\r\\nI only watched the original three years ago, almost to the day in fact, but I was anticipating this follow-up after thoroughly loving the Russell Crowe film. Honestly, I think I kinda enjoyed this sequel more - at worst, the two are on the same level, for me anyway. Crowe is missed, though everyone in this movie more than makes up for his (obvious) absence.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is the first time I've seen Paul Mescal act, despite knowing of him for quite a while now. I'm impressed! He delivers a showing of great strength (pardon the pun). Pedro Pascal is very good too, as is Joseph Quinn; I wasn't instantly sold on the latter when he appeared onscreen, though when all is said and done I rate his performance positively.\\r\\n\\r\\nDenzel Washington... what a geezer. I'll never tire or turn down the chance at seeing that man act. Needless to say, given he's one of two favourite actors of mine, I loved his performance all the way through. The likes of Fred Hechinger and Connie Nielsen merit fair praise as well, interesting to see Rory McCann and Matt Lucas in there too.\\r\\n\\r\\nOh, and the score... superb! Deafeningly grand.\",\n",
       "  'Sixteen years after \"Maximus\" (Russell Crowe) bit the dust, we find ancient Rome under the control of twins \"Geta\" (Joseph Quinn) and his brother \"Caracalla\" (Fred Hechinger) and thanks to their general \"Acacias\" (Pedro Pascal) continuing to expand their empire. It\\'s this latter man who leads an attack on the home \"Nanno\" (Paul Mescal) shares with his wife \"Arishat\" (Yuval Gonen). That doesn\\'t go so well and next thing, she\\'s gone on ahead of him to the wheat fields and he\\'s now a slave owned by the manipulative \"Macrinus\" (Denzel Washington) heading to the Colosseum to entertain the emperors and their cousin \"Lucilla\" (Connie Nielsen). What now ensues is a well produced and good looking rehash of the first film paying homage en route to \"Spartacus\" and it\\'s the sheer predicability that I struggled with. It\\'s episodically delivered with far too much script and though Mescal tries hard, his performance is largely charm-free and as wooden as a rudius, especially once the rather far-fetched familial back-story has been established. Sir Derek Jacobi sparingly appears as the other survivor from 2000 reprising his role as the senator \"Gracchus\" but to no real effect and the scene stealer for me is really only the megalomanic Quinn\\'s imperial offering as he and his bonkers sibling teeter on the brink of inbred, sexually fluid, madness. Washington does well enough as the scheming slave-master, but he hasn\\'t really enough to work with to stand out amongst what really are a mediocre collection of undercooked characters that just don\\'t deliver any real sense of the hedonism and menace of this debauched and corrupt state. As with Sir Ridley Scott\\'s \"Kingdom of Heaven\" (2005) the battle scenes are superb and action packed, as are the combat scenes in the vast marble auditorium filled with baying plebs and rhinos, but I am afraid that the shallow characterisations just didn\\'t work well enough to keep this engaging and the plot was just too thin to stretch over a couple of hours that could have been so very much better. It really does need a big screen to appreciate the creatively crafted visuals, but I was still pretty disappointed, sorry.',\n",
       "  'Comparisons will be inevitable and Gladiator II will never be as iconic as the 2000 classic. However it is very good, strong all-around with gripping action and a well executed script. Performances are very good, with some pleasant surprises.',\n",
       "  \"Gladiator II features some impressive action sequences. Every battle in the Colosseum is fantastic despite how historically inaccurate they may be. The monkey sequence showcases how skilled Hanno (Paul Mescal) is not only as a fighter but also in how he interacts with others. Then there's the rhino sequence that plays out much like Bugs Bunny’s interactions with Toro the Bull in the Chuck Jones-directed Looney Tunes short Bully for Bugs (1953).\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile those sequences are fairly believable, the shark sequence seems like pure fantasy and that’s why it’s so incredible. They fill the Colosseum with water and let sharks loose while the opposing gladiators try to survive the onslaught on boats.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt’s also interesting to note that every major actor who dies in the film has a spectacular death. Not only that but these gruesome deaths get increasingly more grisly and memorable as the film progresses. These bloody triumphs rarely delve any deeper than someone getting shot with a bunch of arrows or a beheading or appendage severing of some kind. This level of brutality escalates throughout the film and eventually culminates with the most satisfying kill that takes two and a half hours to achieve.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe performances fluctuate between being top-tier perfection and mediocre overacting. Denzel Washington is having the time of his life as Macrinus. He has the most interesting storyline and Denzel dances in every scene with a giddiness that is unparalleled. Joseph Quinn seems to be acting in an entirely different film than everyone else as Emperor Geta. His mannerisms are operatic and theatrical with his wide eyes that rarely blink, grand body language and hand gestures, and explosive line delivery.\\r\\n\\r\\nPedro Pascal doesn’t do anything in Gladiator II as Marcus Acacius that he didn’t do in Game of Thrones apart from having more screen time. Much like how his character is written, Paul Mescal’s performance is muddled. The Hanno character and who he is is a poorly kept secret that consistently pulls the character in several directions.\\r\\n\\r\\nHanno is vengeful at first before succumbing to being the hero of the film and the evolution isn’t earned. The writing and pacing of Gladiator II feel like the film drops Hanno’s fate in his lap halfway through, which he’s either forgotten about over two decades or never knew until the audience did.\\r\\n\\r\\nConnie Nielsen, one of the few returning actors from the original film, is awful in this. Her acting in Gladiator II always comes off as forced as her crying scenes are often portrayed as constipated grunts with crocodile tears. Her dialogue delivery is also strained and broken despite being given some of the most important sequences of character connections and reawakenings of sorts in the sequel.\\r\\n\\r\\nCalling Gladiator II action-heavy is misleading because the film drags between every fight sequence. The film is largely dull and difficult to indulge during its quieter moments. The film is gorgeous with its incredible set pieces, intricate costume design, and impressive use of infinitely numerous extras. Director Ridley Scott reunites with all of the set decorators (Sonja Klaus, Crispian Sallis, and Emilio Ardura) and costume designer (Janty Yates) that he worked with on Gladiator in 2000. From a visual standpoint, Ridley Scott's films are highly detailed masterpieces.\\r\\n\\r\\nDenzel Washington’s extravagant performance makes Gladiator II worthwhile. Still, not even its excessively violent action sequences, beautiful cinematography, and masterful set and costume design can save the sequel from how boring it is. Ridley Scott waited over twenty years to make a sequel that is more than twice as expensive as the original only to rehash the same story points.\",\n",

       " [\"A solid enough send off for this <em>'Venom'</em> trilogy.\\r\\n\\r\\n<em>'Venom: The Last Dance'</em> is decently amusing and produces enough entertainment with its plot. I didn't personally find it overly funny, though the person a few seats across from me had an absolute blast - never a bad thing seeing people enjoy themselves!\\r\\n\\r\\nTom Hardy remains the key element of these films, they would be far less enjoyable without his presence. There's a nice montage of sorts towards the end, it admittedly didn't 'hit' all that much for me but I imagine it's effective for proper fans of the series.

       "  'Perhaps this was just one sequel too many as the story here is really rather thin, but there\\'s still enough chemistry between \"Eddie\" (Tom Hardy) and his eponymous symbion to raise a smile or two. This time it\\'s not just the pursuing human population that\\'s a problem for them, but there are creatures from the homeworld of \"Venom\" homing in on their unique \"codex\" so that they can help free their leader from incarceration to wreak havoc on the universe. Along the way, they encounter the hippie \"Martin\" (Rhys Ifans) and his family and cadge a lift in their VW camper-van whilst offering a fairly tuneless rendition of some David Bowie. It all builds up to a fairly predictable denouement with humanity facing some tough choices, the seemingly indestructible aliens on the verge of success and our intrepid partnership having to consider the ultimate sacrifice. Yep, we\\'ve seen it all before and though the visual effects are pretty impressive, that\\'s not really enough to sustain it as it rather procedurally rolls along. There is occasionally some wit in the script and Hardy looks like he\\'s having fun, but Chiwetel Ejiofor is largely under-used and it relies far too heavily on repetitive combat scenes to really make it stand out amidst the surfeit of 2024 comic-book derivatives.

Secondly, there\\'s the interplay between Hardy and Venom which can be genuinely funny. \\r\\n\\r\\nThis latest and possibly last film in the series, \"Venom: The Last Dance\", is, I believe, the weakest in the line up.

That said, it still has its moments of engaging humour and not half decent action.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn summary, its a shame to see \"Venom\" shelved (if in fact that\\'s the case) as its one of the better Marvel universe franchises, with great chemistry between Hardy and his other worldly alter ego, Venom.

There are some genuinely fun and heartfelt moments that remind you why this duo worked in the first place.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut man, the rest? A hot mess. The plot is all over the map, the new characters are forgettable, and the villain? Weak sauce. It feels like the filmmakers just kind of shrugged and said, “Eh, good enough.” Sure, there are flashes of that buddy-comedy charm, but not enough to save the movie from feeling like it’s limping to the finish line.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf this is the final Venom movie (and I hope it is), I’m not gonna cry about it. It’s a mixed bag—fun in bits, but overall, it’s like Venom himself: a bit too sloppy to fully love.'],\n",
       " [\"Following Leigh Whannell’s reimagining of The Invisible Man, he returns for Wolf Man. Originally intended to be part of Universal Pictures Dark Universe, which was scrapped after Tom Cruise’s The Mummy failed to meet expectations at the box office, reinterpretations of Universal monster movies are still planned, but as individual stories on a much smaller scale.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Wolf Man, we’re introduced to a young boy who goes hunting with his father. Their relationship is strained, mostly due to the father’s intimidating parenting. They encounter something on their hunt—not fully animal but not quite man—and nearly succumb to the creature’s bloodlust.\\r\\n\\r\\n30 years later, that boy is now a man named Blake (Christopher Abbott) who now lives in New York City with his journalist wife Charlotte (Julia Garner) and daughter Ginger (Matilda Firth). Blake is notified that his father has passed away and has to return to the family farm in Oregon to retrieve his belongings.\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce in Oregon, Blake and his family are attacked and run off the road by a similar creature. While his family makes it to his father’s farm, Blake is wounded and starts to get sick, but his sickness becomes dangerous and inhuman while his family is suddenly no longer safe around him.\\r\\n\\r\\nLeigh Whannell is no stranger to the genre with Saw and Insidious being other horror franchises he helped shape since their inception. Wolf Man is not what you expect it to be as this isn’t a werewolf film. Most werewolf lore like being affected by the full moon, silver bullets being a weakness, and the typical all-over wolf-like transformation are tossed out the window here.\\r\\n\\r\\nWritten by Whannell and his wife Corbett Tuck, Wolf Man’s first draft was inspired by the COVID-19 pandemic and specifically being isolated from the rest of the world. This isn’t a monstrous transformation that goes away when the sun comes up, it’s a sickness. The film describes the sickness as a fever with the face of a wolf. Whannell was inspired by David Cronenberg’s The Fly and it shows. Blake’s horrid transition into this rabid, hairy Neanderthal is brutal and disgusting at times.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe most impressive part of the creature design is that it was done practically, but it’s ugly to look at otherwise. Think Jack Nicholson in Wolf, but with less hair and more protruding flesh. Wolf Man is generally more effective when the creature isn’t shown. The opening of Blake with his father hiding in the treehouse in the forest while it rains is so masterfully done. You hear the creature snarling as it claws at the wood paneling and you see its breath to signify just how close it is to jumping on its prey.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you see Wolf Man, see it either in theaters or somewhere with incredible surround sound. The sound design of the film is a big part of its charm. Not only is this because of the creature, but the forest of the farm in Oregon has a life of its own with crackling thunder, the sound of rain falling all around you, and trees creaking.\\r\\n\\r\\nWolf Man essentially stalls after Blake becomes this creature. The story gets him back to Oregon easily enough, but the screenplay can’t decide if Blake still recognizes his family or not. He has this weird wolf vision that allows him to see things in the dark and he suddenly can’t understand English like everything sounds like Charlie Brown gibberish. Blake has a deep connection with his daughter and Wolf Man builds up this, “I love you 3000,” moment between them, but when that moment inevitably comes it falls flat and it's washed away with a disgruntled groan.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne minute Blake is saving his family and the next he’s trying to kill them. It’s supposed to illustrate that he’s losing himself to the sickness and he’s becoming less and less like himself the more he has it. The disappointment from the film is more of how the film is written because the actors are quite good. Julia Garner emotionally carries the film and Christopher Abbott portrays so much with his eyes in his performance underneath the mounds of prosthetics.\\r\\n\\r\\nEven the finale abruptly stops without much of a conclusion. It’s likely hinting at an open direction for the surviving characters, but a pan out from behind as they look up at the night sky is a little lame.\\r\\n\\r\\nWolf Man features some incredible performances from its cast with a heart-racing score that pays tribute to the werewolf films it was inspired by. But even with the film boasting its practical effects, the creature design is ultimately underwhelming and the story runs around aimlessly in the woods because there’s nowhere else for the film to go.\",\n",
       "  'Well give him his due, Leigh Whannell made sure his name appears on screen often enough, but sadly what\\'s he striven to churn out here is nothing remotely innovative. It\\'s all about \"Blake\" (Christopher Abbott) who\\'s been estranged from his rather militaristic dad for as long as he\\'s been an adult. He lives, albeit increasingly distantly, with his wife \"Charlotte\" (Julia Garner) and daughter \"Ginger\" (Matilda Firth) in the big city but when his father is declared legally dead, decides it\\'s a great opportunity to visit the wilderness of Oregon to sort through his belongings. Off they set through the forest driving a removals van, in the dark, with no real idea where they are going. By pure fluke, they encounter \"Derek\" (Benedict Hardie) who remembers \"Blake\" as a child and offers to guide them. Next thing there\\'s an apparition, then loads of broken branches before a scene reminiscent of \"Jurassic Park\" (1993) with their van precariously perched half way up (or down) a tree. There\\'s something menacing out there and they have to make it to the safety of the house. Easier said than done, though, as en route poor old \"Blake\" gets himself scratched. Once in the house, they hope to sit it out - but is their enemy inside this iron-bar clad house, or...? At times it is quite tensely directed using the forest, the darkness and cracking-branch audio to decent effect, but the dialogue is inane and it suffers from a common flaw amongst horror films of late. The characters make the most ridiculous of decisions. Nobody in their right mind would go a-wandering through the woods at night at the best of times. I know they are both supposed to be writers, so unlikely to be overly tapped into popular culture, but surely one of them would have watched an horror movie in their lives and realised the stupidity of that and virtually all of their other courses of action. On that front, it\\'s \"Charlotte\" who gets the gong for being the daftest of the daft. The make-up, prosthetics and visual effects folks deserve some plaudits here on their well crafted work as the film advances, but as for the remainder. Well it\\'s a just another log cabin in the woods style of short story that struggles to sustain itself into a feature length movie we haven\\'t seen dozens of times before.',\n",

I thought he would looke more like the classic but once I put that aside I truly enjoyed this movie. Lily Depp\\'s physical performance actually surprised me and she deserves some recognition for it.',\n",
       "  \"<em>'Nosferatu'</em> didn't quite hook me, but there is enough about it that I can consider it as a good film. The visuals are splendid, as are the gothic horror elements. On the cast, Lily-Rose Depp impresses, as does (more minimally) Emma Corrin and I'm always happy to see Willem Dafoe.\\r\\n\\r\\nI do continue to feel quite nonplussed by Nicholas Hoult. I did like him in fellow 2024 release <em>'Juror #2'</em>, but in this I've kinda reverted to feeling unmoved by him onscreen. I'm not entirely sure why as he seems a likeable chap, yet his performances just don't really register - which admittedly sounds harsher than I intended.\\r\\n\\r\\nBill Skarsgård as Count Orlok is also a part of this flick that I'm unsure on. Does he look the real deal? Absolutely, no complaints there, but I particularly found the dialogue with him to be a borderline bumbling mess. I found the scenes directly with Count to be the least interesting.\\r\\n\\r\\nI would also say that the movie goes on for a bit too long, though I admit that probably is more of a personal shout than one that is to be set in stone; because if you love this, it'll be the perfect length I'm sure. For me, I feel like they went around the houses a tad. With that said, I did highly enjoy that final scene with Depp - very good!\\r\\n\\r\\nThose last paragraphs make it sound like I have a dislike for this film. I do not. It just has some noteworthy points that I felt the need to mention. As I type, having not looked at how this has been received, I'd be shocked if this wasn't rated high. Either way, this is worth a watch.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is my third Robert Eggers film. I loved <em>'The Northman'</em> (9/10) but I, honestly, hated <em>'The Lighthouse'</em> (4/10). Safe to say this falls exactly down the middle, in terms of how I think of it. Quite a stark contrast even so, kinda fascinated to see how <em>'The Witch'</em> hits me when I get around to that at some point.\",\n",

That could change, though, as his boss \"Knock\" (Simon McBurney) charges him with a very special mission. He must travel from his German home to the mountains of Carpathia where he must facilitate the sale of a ruined manor house to the reclusive \"Count Orlok\" (Bill Skarsgård). His journey is riddled with portents of suspicion and doom; those he encounters warm him to turn back - but on he goes until he arrives at the castle and is greeted by his enigmatic host. What he thinks is the contract to seal the deal on the house is anything but, as he is soon tormented in his dreams. Many hundreds of miles away, his wife is also suffering - and that causes his best friend \"Friedrich\" (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) to call in \"Dr. Sievers\" (Ralph Ineson) who in turn looks to the scientifically ostracised \"Prof. von Franz\" (Willem Dafoe) for some answers. There are no tangible causes, and the professor quickly concludes that it is evil that\\'s at work and that the continuing and inexplicable absence of her husband, his employer and a recently arrived plague of rats are all part of the supernatural causes of her melancholy. There might be a solution, but that requires an act of supreme sacrifice on the part of the young \"Ellen\", or can her husband and his friends find another way? I\\'m not really a fan of two-parters, but I think in this case that might have been a better solution for Robert Eggers. We have a brief historical introduction to the Count and to the underlying cause of all of the troubles for \"Ellen\" but for the first hour of the film we don\\'t really develop the characters enough, nor sow the seeds for the mysticism especially well. He relies too heavily on our knowledge of the Galeen story of \"Nosferatu\" (as opposed to the Bram Stoker \"Dracula\" one). I could have done with more depth to that chronology. Once \"Orlok\" is on his voyage and afterwards in the town where his merciless behaviour causes misery and panic, we seem to hit the accelerator and rush to the conclusion as if the cock really were about to crow any minute. There simply isn\\'t time to allow the menace to accumulate. Though the visuals are impressively bleak, most of the acting is remarkably bland. Hoult manages to exude some decent terror now and again, but ATJ is really wooden; it takes too long for Depp to show us what she can bring to this under-exposed character and we just don\\'t see anywhere near enough of the ghoulish \"Orlok\" to understand what this story is essentially all about. It\\'s a gothic, dark, gloomy love story. A story of deceit and betrayal and I wanted more. I wanted to feel a little more invested in the characters: to sympathise, to pity, to fear, even. Perhaps a director\\'s cut is in the offing? It\\'s a great watch on a big screen, but I have to admit to being just a little disappointed.',\n",

The problem is, it feels obsessively over stylised, to the point of leaden Gothic oppressiveness. Its a quality that infects the characterisations, as well. They feel over stated, too much larger than life (or is that death) and as a a result, at times, farcical. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe story itself, to those who have read Bram Stoker\\'s \"Dracula\", is mostly familiar.  A few amendments have been made to bring it more in line with the original  \"Nosferatu\" directed by F. W. Murnau, way back in 1922. Count Dracula has been replaced by Count Orlock, for example. I did feel the ending (which also departs from the novel) was a \"bit thin\" and somewhat underwhelming.\\r\\n\\r\\nI will say, in spite of its limitations, I don\\'t hate this film. Its clear a lot of effort and care has been invested into its creation. I think too, certain dramatic and visual aspects of the Gothic film noir approach, are creepily memorable. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn summary, \"Nosferatu\" is a valiant effort that would have been markedly better with gentler handling. A balance of the dark aspects of the film with a more subtle, lighter approach would have led to a superior final product. \\r\\n\\r\\nUltimately a rather emotionally and visually, cumbersome watch, you might want to spread over a couple of days or evenings.'],\n",

       " ['I was so excited because this movie is based on two rich sources of Star Trek lore, Emperor Philippa Georgiou, and Section 31.  What a let down.  This movie is an insult to Star Trek fans everywhere.  It fails at every level.',\n",
       "  'As a lifelong diehard “Star Trek” fan, I find it almost unfathomable to think that I would end up writing something negative about a franchise with which I have long been so deeply enamored – until now. The Paramount+ network’s first effort at creating a standalone “Trek” feature film is, to be honest, dreadful. “Section 31” is a picture with so many problems that it’s hard to know where to begin. For starters, the narrative is so convoluted that it’s difficult to follow without taking notes or constantly hitting the rewind button. In large part, that’s probably because the creators of this mess don’t appear to know what story – or what kind of story – they want to tell. There are allusions to so many different contributing influences that it’s hard to keep track of them all. The film is peppered with references to such properties as “Guardians of the Galaxy,” “Mission: Impossible” and “The Fifth Element,” among others, with precious little actually having to do with “Star Trek” (unless, of course, you count the rampant, utterly annoying silliness of the Lower Decks animated series), almost as if the finished product were designed by committee. Perhaps the most egregious sin here, however, is the picture’s drastic change in the nature of what the Section 31 storyline is all about. As introduced in Star Trek: Deep Space Nine and reintroduced in Star Trek: Discovery, Section 31 has traditionally been portrayed as an enigmatic, exceedingly dark, eminently sinister presence in the world of this franchise, far different from the significantly more visible, almost goofy depiction presented here. This is such a radical departure that, realistically speaking, it can hardly carry the “Section 31” moniker (or, some might even say, the “Star Trek” label itself). That’s regrettable, given that this storyline is one that, if it had been handled differently, could have been developed into a more fully fleshed out vehicle than it has been up to this point in its legacy (including as a series of its own). As it stands now, though, if this production is any indication of where it might be headed (if anywhere), it would seem that its creators are determined to take Section 31 in an entirely different direction from where it began (and not in a good way at that). To its credit, director Olatunde Osunsanmi’s fourth feature film incorporates some fine work yet again from its protagonist, smarmy, uber-sarcastic camp queen Michelle Yeoh, as well as some genuinely impressive, visually dazzling special effects. But, as a vehicle capable of maintaining viewer interest and giving Section 31 a viable future, I don’t see it. In all truthfulness, I’m not one of those nitpicking Trekkers who mercilessly criticizes every little detail that supposedly deviates from the mythology’s elusive canon (how annoying), but this offering represents such a marked divergence from where Section 31 originated that I can barely recognize it. If Section 31 is to have any kind of life going forward, it truly needs to get back to where it came from and forget that this monstrosity was ever created.',\n",

Regrettably, though, on this occasion, the story lacks direction, a semblance of credibility and simple logic. \\r\\n\\r\\nYes, sci fi is fantasy, you can go wild but the premise still needs to be believable, if the audience is to invest in it. In this instance, I found little to compel me to invest in the tale being told and the characterisations.

Gleaming and plump, the yolk suddenly gets pricked – not by a fork, but a syringe.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat’s the first juicy visual metaphor of many in this meaningfully bonkers body horror, for which French filmmaker Coralie Fargeat picked up the prestigious Best Screenplay prize at this year’s Cannes Film Festival.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo call the film ‘bold’ is a weapons-grade understatement.

       "  \"Demi Moore's performance in The Substance is so potent that it's hard to tell what's more intoxicating; her inevitable Best Actress win or Coralie Fargeat's razor-sharp screenplay that's already got the Oscar in the bag.\",\n",
       "  'There’s a big difference between being funny and being laughable, yet the latest from writer-director Coralie Fargeat has somehow found a way to be both. After amassing a considerable amount of largely well-earned cinematic goodwill in the film’s opening segments, the picture mercilessly squanders that support in the final act with an overlong, meandering, disgustingly gratuitous and grotesque exhibition of utterly bad taste. This story of an aging actress (Demi Moore) who seeks to revive her career by retrieving some of her lost youth with the aid of an enigmatic injectable follows her grand misadventures when the mysterious substance prompts the emergence of a younger doppelganger (Margaret Qualley), who becomes a Hollywood sex kitten sensation virtually overnight. To make this experimental venture work, however, the two individuals must follow a complex set of rules, dictates that become increasingly difficult to follow as they each vie for their respective shares of attention. And, as this scenario unfolds, tension grows between them, leading to complications and unexpected developments that become progressively harder to manage. But that’s where what works in the film ends. As the story plays out from there, it becomes stupendously absurd, and, even though there are some hearty laughs in this, there are even more ridiculously implausible and unexplained occurrences that try audience members’ patience and tolerance, so much so that I couldn’t wait for this trainwreck to end. In addition to the foregoing shortcomings, the film includes myriad changes in tone, making it difficult to determine whether this is supposed to be a serious thriller or a campy road, very much in the same way as in the incomprehensible French offering “Titane” (2021). It also shamelessly “borrows” elements from other movies in various ways, most notably imagery and narrative references from “The Shining” (1980) and “Young Frankenstein” (1974), costume designs from the “Hunger Games” franchise, and bafflingly inexplicable soundtrack excerpts from films like “Vertigo” (1958). Then there’s the picture’s obvious, heavy-handed message about the perils of misogyny, observations that, as important as they are, could easily stood to have been turned down more than a few notches (yes, we get it already). At the same time, though, there are also some fundamentally innate questions about the narrative that go wholly unanswered, leaving us with numerous head-scratching moments. Sadly, these failings detract significantly from the elements that do work (at least early on in the film), such as the fine performances of Moore and Qualley, the picture’s inventive cinematography, and a central premise that could have made for an engaging story if handled with greater finesse. But these strengths are effectively cancelled by what ultimately results when this release goes off the rails. Indeed, how “The Substance” captured the 2024 Cannes Film Festival award for best screenplay is truly mind boggling. I’m certainly a fan of the weird, wild and wacky, but this release undermines the virtues of those cherished qualities. Regrettably, I was seriously looking forward to seeing this offering, and I was decidedly impressed by what I saw in its opening acts, but that was all wiped out by how this one ultimately played out, a picture that, in the end, ironically relied more on style than “substance.”',\n",
       "  'This takes a logical step on from Coralie Fargeat\\'s earlier \"Reality+\" (2014) drama, only this time it takes a much more substantial swipe at all things vain. \"Elisabeth\" (Demi Moore) has been at the top of her fitness game for many a year when her boss \"Harvey\" (Dennis Quaid) decides that she\\'s now too old and that a younger model is needed to present those programmes we all saw on the television of gorgeous, fit and healthy, people showing us how to exercise on a mat in from of our televisions each morning. Distracted by her imminent removal, she is involved in a car accident that introduces her to an handsome young nurse (Robin Grear) and then to a curious invitation to test out a mysterious fluid that can essentially give her her cake and eat it. In best \"Jekyll and Hyde\" tradition, injecting this quite literally creates a split personality. One is her current self, the other a perfect, younger specimen. They work in a rota system each gets a week of consciousness then has to take a week out. Thing is, the more vivacious character \"Sue\" (Margaret Qualley) is not so religious about sticking to these sharing rules and we quickly discover that what is \"borrowed\" can never been returned - with increasingly harrowing results. With the gushing \"Harvey\" determined to capitalise on his new ratings winner, things become decidedly irritating for the now marginalised \"Elisabeth\" - but shat can she do? There\\'s no going back...! I think this is Moore at her best. Her palpable sense of evolving fury, exasperation and frustration is expertly captured as is the selfishness of her alter ego by an on form Qualley. Quaid steals his scenes as the truly odious epitome of corporate greed for whom it\\'s all about the business, the money and never the actual people concerned. The denouement is reminiscent of something concocted by one of the David\\'s - Lynch or Cronenberg, and allows the throbbing ghastliness of this story of vanity gone mad to demonstrate just how fickle life can be when there\\'s little actual substance at all to their shallow and vacuous lives. A savage indictment of the short-term and unprincipled \"beauty\" industry that aims squarely at just about everyone and everything involved, is engagingly toxic and well worth a watch.',\n",
       "  \"Certainly an experience!\\r\\n\\r\\n<em>'The Substance'</em> is <b>a lot</b>. It's one of those sorta movies that I needed to let settle in my mind before I even started to think about reviewing it. I'm not even sure where to start. It's insane from pretty much the beginning to the very end of its 140 minute run time, some scenes are particularly rough to watch unfold!\\r\\n\\r\\nI think the only body horror flick I've seen up until this point is David Cronenberg's <em>'Crimes of the Future'</em> from 2022, which I found to be solid enough but it came across, at least to me, as a bit too forced for shock value. This 2024 release has plenty of that, if not more, but it somehow feels totally at home with what surrounds it.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe story itself is fascinating, even taking out all the craziness with the gore et al. So by no means is this a film that is style over substance (sorry). It isn't anything actually overly original in terms of the base plotline, though the way it is portrayed and brought to life is astounding - every inch is expertly crafted.\\r\\n\\r\\nDemi Moore is outstanding in this! I haven't seen her in much, at least anything released post-2002, but here she is top quality throughout. Margaret Qualley is obviously the opposite in terms of the former, though is just as fantastic in regards to the latter - great performance!\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you see anyone giving warnings ahead of watching this, they are very much warranted! Even with all the graphic twistedness, which will turn many away, this is an impressively enthralling picture. I may need a lie-down though.\",\n",

Dennis Quaid and Margaret Qualley are right up there with her and Fargeat in playing over-the-top choices.',\n",
       "  '**The Substance (2024)**\\r\\nA Visceral Exploration of Youth Obsession and the Fear of Time\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The Substance\" is a bold cinematic experience that masterfully resurrects the practical effects of 1980s horror, delivering a visual and auditory feast that is both nostalgic and groundbreaking. Directed with a keen eye for detail, the film delves deep into society\\'s obsession with youth and the inevitable passage of time, offering a thought-provoking commentary wrapped in visceral horror.\\r\\nThe film follows a renowned actress, portrayed by Demi Moore, who grapples with the fear of aging and losing her fame. In a desperate attempt to reclaim her youth, she becomes entangled with a mysterious substance that promises vitality but comes with horrifying consequences. As she navigates this treacherous path, the lines between reality and obsession blur, leading to a descent into madness.\\r\\nAt its core, \"The Substance\" is a critique of the 21st-century fixation on youth over the value of life experience. It echoes themes from classics like \"Death Becomes Her\" and \"The Picture of Dorian Gray,\" highlighting the shame associated with aging and the societal pressure to maintain perpetual youthfulness. The film questions whether society promotes a \\'sexy reality\\' at the expense of genuine substance and wisdom.\\r\\nThe narrative explores the concept of cheating death, not just literally but metaphorically, as a fear of social death—being forgotten or replaced. This is poignantly portrayed through Moore\\'s character, who embodies the desperation of clinging to relevance in a world that idolizes the new and discards the old.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Practical Effects and Gore**\\r\\nFrom the opening scenes, it\\'s evident that the physical effects are a labor of love—a homage to the era before CGI dominated horror. The gore is unapologetically front and center, reminiscent of Cronenberg\\'s \"The Fly,\" pushing the boundaries of on-screen grotesque. The disturbingly realistic blood effects, combined with meticulously crafted sound design, amplify the discomfort, making the audience squirm.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Color Palette and Visual Aesthetics**\\r\\nThe color palette is meticulously crafted, bathing scenes in hues that evoke unease and familiarity simultaneously. The use of shadows and lighting enhances the suspense, while the wardrobe and costume design serve as narrative devices, illustrating the juxtaposition between youth and age, purity and corruption.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Performances**\\r\\nDemi Moore delivers a stellar performance, capturing the vulnerability and desperation of a woman battling the relentless march of time. Her portrayal adds depth to the film\\'s themes, embodying the internal decay and obsession manifesting physically through the substance. The supporting cast also contributes significantly, with each character representing different facets of society\\'s views on youth and aging.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Critique**\\r\\nWhile the film excels in many areas, it isn\\'t without flaws. The ending feels abrupt, leaving several narrative threads untied, which may leave some viewers unsatisfied. Additionally, the persistent focus on teen emotional states can be grating, potentially alienating those seeking a more mature exploration of the presented themes.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Engaging with the Hype**\\r\\n\"The Substance\" has generated significant buzz online, sparking discussions about its innovative use of practical effects and its deep societal commentary. The hype seems to stem from both horror enthusiasts who appreciate the throwback to classic techniques and audiences resonating with its timely themes. However, it\\'s worth considering whether the film is merely feeding into the very cycle of superficiality it aims to criticize.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The Substance\" is a visceral commentary on the fear of aging, the obsession with youth, and the inevitable march of time. It challenges viewers to reflect on their perceptions of age, experience, and what truly holds value. By drawing parallels with films like \"Gremlins,\" \"Frankenstein,\" \"A Christmas Carol,\" and \"Carrie,\" it positions itself as a modern amalgamation of timeless themes.\\r\\nDespite its imperfections, the film succeeds in sparking conversation—a hallmark of impactful cinema. It\\'s as uncomfortable as it is thought-provoking, demanding to be felt and discussed. Whether you love it or hate it, \"The Substance\" is a noteworthy addition to the horror genre that holds up a mirror to society\\'s own fears and obsessions.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Extra Thoughts**\\r\\n- The film raises pertinent questions about our role in perpetuating the fear of aging. Are we complicit in creating a world where experience is devalued?\\r\\n- The character dynamics suggest that embracing change and maintaining balance might be key to a fulfilling life, even if it comes at a cost.\\r\\n- The hype surrounding the movie could reflect its resonance with audiences grappling with similar fears and obsessions in today\\'s youth-centric culture.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Final Recommendation**\\r\\n\"The Substance\" may not offer all the answers, but it provides a platform for dialogue on important societal issues. Its blend of classic horror techniques with contemporary themes makes it a film worth experiencing. If you\\'re a fan of thought-provoking horror that goes beyond mere scares, this movie deserves a place on your watchlist.',\n",
       "  '\"The Substance\" is something of a cinematic mash up. \\r\\n\\r\\nFirst off, this story is somewhat  reminiscent of \"Death Becomes Her\". The 1992 film starring Meryl Streep, Goldie Hawn and Bruce Willis. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe notion of the fatal conceit in the search for eternal youth amongst the ageing Hollywood set is very much central to the story in both films.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat said, the handling is distinctly different. This film is a lot louder, gaudier, brasher, cruder and ruder, than its 90\\'s counterpart by a country mile. There are elements I\\'d typically associate with Lovecraft too, that are grotesque, monstrous and disturbing. \\r\\n\\r\\nThis work is also more a visually clever, as opposed to narrative experience. Its messages are conveyed, like Hollywood itself, through larger than life youthful glitz and glamour but also an innate, ephemeral shallowness.A shallowness that becomes a kind of obsessive prison, denying those trapped in it, any meaningful form of human intimacy.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy only criticism of what I do feel is a very good film, is it overplays its hand. Its so over the top in the latter part of the film, I felt it partly drowned out the message, it had, up to that point, convincingly conveyed. The closing scenes. in particular, felt crude, clumsy and would have worked considerably better, with more controlled and subtle, handling. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn summary, \"The Substance\" is a rather clever film that uses the eye of the lens to expose how what we see, in Hollywood at least, is more important than who we are. People are shiny commodities to be replaced when the beautiful image they portray starts to wither away. As we see, youth and beauty is everything, no matter the price. \\r\\n\\r\\nI will say too, this is by no means a perfect cinematic experience. It can be over the top, especially in the latter part of the film. That said, there is, on balance, more to like here than not. Definitely worth a look.',\n",
       "  \"A disaster.

       "  'In moviemaking, sadly, there can be a problem with going to the well too many times, and this latest installment in one of filmdom’s better cinematic franchises verges on proving just that. This offering’s predecessors (2016, 2018) significantly distinguished themselves from the kind of fare typically found in the superhero genre with their outrageously bawdy humor, hilarious sight gags and relentlessly maverick attitude. This time out, however, director Shawn Levy’s latest effort is a decidedly hit or miss affair, with an often-incoherent script that feels like it was cobbled together from a collection of leftover parts, some of which work and some of which don’t. I suppose that’s not entirely surprising from a screenplay that was penned by four different writers, making me wonder how much consensus was in place in compiling the finished product. Moreover, this film appears to be intended to fold the Deadpool franchise into the X-Men franchise, an intriguing idea that, regrettably, is handled rather clumsily (as has often been the case with many other recent fusion offerings in the Marvel Universe). And, if all that weren’t bad enough, this release gives short shrift to the colorful cast of supporting players that made the Deadpool films so funny, original and enjoyable, relegating them to little more than cameos in favor of walk-ons by a host of other MCU characters (some of them remarkably obscure, I might add) in an attempt to help cement the franchise cross-pollination going on here. It makes for awkward storytelling at times, especially for viewers who might not be familiar with these lesser-known figures, some of which are drawn from Marvel source material unrelated to its big screen offerings. To the picture’s credit, it features yet another stellar turn by Ryan Reynolds as the off-color protagonist, as well as its share of hilarious bits (without a doubt the franchise’s historically strongest suit), including a number of unabashed, razor-sharp asides referencing off-screen developments related to the studios that produced these films and the actors who have appeared in them. These strengths notwithstanding, however, this is a production that has sadly watered down the elements that best made this franchise work in favor of an overarching programming agenda that simply doesn’t serve this film or the series particularly well. The creators would have served themselves and viewers better by sticking with what works and the basics of good storytelling than trying to force an issue for the sake of future productions that may or may not work over the long term. This has been a noticeable downfall in the quality of many of the most recent Marvel Universe releases, and I’d truly hate to see this franchise befall a similar fate.',\n",

       "  'Well the \"Deadpool\" concept is now well and truly immersed in the Marvel multi-verse and I really did fear for good old \"Dead\". More of the same? Well, no actually. Ryan Reynolds has reverted more to the occasionally quite vulgar humour of the first film (2016) and allowed this trequel to focus more on the personality of this irreverent, immortal, superhero as he tries to resurrect the recently departed \"Wolverine/Logan\" (Hugh Jackman) so he can save his timeline from erasure. To do that, and thwart the comically menacing \"Paradox\" (Matthew Macfadyen), he has to face down \"Cassandra Nova\" (Emma Corrin) - who happens to be the long estranged twin sister of \"Xavier\" who presides over the void. That\\'s a \"Mad Max\" style desert style territory where all the undesirables have been put by \"Paradox\" and his organisation over the years. Initially, there\\'s no love lost between our two heroes. The cocky man in red lycra does not impress his new, booze-soaked and guilt-ridden buddy, but quickly they manage to align their priorities and then - well yes, you can guess the rest. Indeed, there\\'s nothing remotely unpredictable about any of this, but what it does do is shout loudly and proudly that it knows it. It\\'s not trying to reinvent the wheel, it\\'s succeeding in pointing out that all of these multi-verse films that simply adjust the space/time continuum to provide a new setting for the same old stories ad characters has to stop before we (the audience) bore further of their repetitive combat cycles and nondescript plot lines. Maybe Reynolds does over-egg the smuttiness a little but there are still plenty of wry comments about the industry, product placement and the plethora of films (and actors) that have preceded it delivering same old same old. It\\'s not forgotten to entertain us too - there are loads of action scenes and there\\'s an amiable chemistry between two actors who are clearly on the same, suitably sarcastic, page throughout a two hours that also features a some fun cameos from the likes of Messrs. Evans, Snipes, Cavill, Favreau and Tatum to keep it moving along with an effervescence of spirit.

       "  \"Deadpool and Wolverine is a movie that I truly believe the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) has needed for a while. After years of lackluster installments, this film is a breath of fresh air. Ryan Reynolds, Hugh Jackman, and director Shawn Levy approached this project with care and a deep understanding of what fans want. The film feels like it was crafted by fans for fans, particularly those who have been frustrated by the recent phases of the MCU.\\r\\n\\r\\nReynolds and Levy brought on a team of writers with a strong background in comedy and storytelling. This decision pays off, as the film’s humor and narrative are both sharp and engaging. For example, the meta vibe of Deadpool, familiar from the previous two films, is ramped up significantly. The movie spares no one, making jokes about everything from Hugh Jackman’s recent divorce to Ryan Reynolds' career. However, it’s the MCU that receives the most pointed and critical jokes, which will resonate with long-time fans.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe chemistry between Reynolds and Jackman is electric, bringing new life to both characters. Their dynamic is both hilarious and heartfelt, making for a compelling narrative. For instance, scenes where Deadpool and Wolverine banter while taking down enemies are filled with wit and energy, showcasing their unique bond. This camaraderie extends to the film’s supporting cast, with well-timed cameos and clever nods to previous Marvel movies.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe film's self-awareness and willingness to poke fun at its own franchise are refreshing. This level of meta-commentary sets the film apart from typical superhero fare.\\r\\n\\r\\nDespite its comedic approach, the film doesn’t skimp on emotional depth. The storyline is carried by genuine heart, particularly in how it addresses themes of redemption and friendship. The climax is especially impactful, ranking among the greats in the franchise.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis isn't just a good sequel; it's a game-changer for the MCU. The film successfully integrates Deadpool into the broader Marvel Cinematic Universe while maintaining his unique tone and style.

The storyline may seem chaotic, but that's all part of the Deadpool charm.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile the villain could have been utilized more effectively given their power, the relationship between Deadpool and Wolverine is beautifully portrayed. The film does a commendable job of explaining the backstory and the humor is on point, with Deadpool's witty jabs and references adding to the entertainment.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you're a fan of Deadpool and his legacy, this movie is a must-watch that will blow your mind.

The movie captures the essence of reading a comic book, where big, crazy choices and wild action sequences keep you at the edge of your seat. The introduction of variants and a plethora of cameos from beloved characters across the Marvel Universe only enhances this feeling, making it a true spectacle for long-time fans.\\r\\n\\r\\nHugh Jackman\\'s portrayal of Wolverine is nothing short of iconic, and this film allows him to fully embrace the character in ways we’ve longed to see.

The emotional depth is surprising, particularly in scenes where _Deadpool and Wolverine_ share poignant moments. One standout is Deadpool\\'s farewell to Wolverine, which is both a nod to the characters\\' shared history and a poignant reminder of their enduring bond.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe film\\'s action sequences are top-tier, with choreography that respects each character\\'s unique fighting style. The inclusion of characters like Elektra, Blade, and even a hilarious cameo from Gambit adds layers of excitement and nostalgia. Wesley Snipes\\' return as Blade, complete with his signature line, \"Some motherfuckers always trying to ice-skate uphill,\" received one of the loudest reactions from the audience.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe story navigates the complexities of timelines and multiverse mechanics with a wink and a nod, never bogging down in overly technical explanations.

The script fails to inject enough fun to offset its cliché formulas, and despite its festive intentions, the film feels stuck in cruise control, never quite capturing the magic or excitement one might hope for from a Christmas blockbuster.\\r\\n\\r\\nTechnically, RED ONE falters with its visuals. Almost every scene feels confined to a studio setting, and inconsistent VFX work makes it difficult to stay immersed in the story. The action sequences, though admittedly frequent, are mostly dimly lit, which diminishes any potential impact they might have had. None of these set pieces stand out, leaving viewers with little to savor beyond the familiar faces on screen. While it's not as terrible as some have claimed, Jake Kasdan ultimately delivers just another forgettable holiday flick, weighed down by formulaic storytelling and overshadowed - quite literally - by its murky, dark aesthetic.\\r\\n\\r\\nRating: C-\",\n",

Johnson is a bit more serious than usual and I liked that, while Evans' character ends up being the heart of the movie. J. K.

It\\'s a fun adventure this one but it is a bit slow, the humour isn\\'t so plentiful and the plot is a little derivative with not enough bear and too much of \"Jungle Cruise\" (2021) meets \"Sound of Music\" (1965) to it. I thought Banderas and Colman rather hammed it all up a bit and there also wasn\\'t quite the cosiness of the family-led escapades with much less opportunity for Dame Julie Walters to get actively involved. The narrative is all just a bit disjointed without the charm of the two earlier cinema outings for Michael Bond\\'s character.

But Paddington and the Browns will need a boat to get there. Enter Hunter Cabot (Antonio Banderas) and his daughter Gina (Carla Tous).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe humor in Paddington in Peru feels like it’s been amped up a bit in comparison to the previous two films. Most of the humor is still physical comedy and is a result of Paddington being clumsy or not understanding his surroundings. But the film makes it a point to showcase the fact that something is fishy with Olivia Colman’s Reverend Mother from the start. It becomes the film’s longest-running gag.\\r\\n\\r\\nHunter Cabot is haunted by the ghosts of his ancestors. The Cabot bloodline is a greedy bunch and unfortunately, that trait plagues Hunter despite his best efforts. He tries to live by the fact that his daughter is his biggest treasure, but the temptation has always been there and Paddington reawakens something awful in him.\\r\\n\\r\\nAntonio Banderas is essentially Burger Beard from The Spongebob Movie: Sponge Out of Water as Hunter Cabot, but with more depth.

Someone could start with this film and enjoy it for what it is before seeing the first two films.\\r\\n\\r\\nPaddington in Peru goes in predictable directions, but the film plays off those expectations masterfully. You know where the story is going to go from the start, but when those big moments come you are still invested and you still cry. The Paddington films have never shied away from embodying what heartfelt and touchy-feely truly mean. If your heartstrings are ever in need of a tune-up, a Paddington film will get them humming like new guaranteed.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Paddington films have always embodied an unparalleled sense of wonder and happiness; being content with the smallest things. Paddington in Peru is no different, but there’s an even bigger emphasis on how big the world is outside of our comfort zone and kindness above all else.  Paddington in Peru is a heartwarming film about embracing your inner bear and discovering how precious home is.'],\n",

       "  \"There are so many movies within the Despicable Me franchise that I've lost count of all the storylines in each. While I've never been a big fan of these movies, they at least always felt exciting. However, this fourth installment in the Gru storyline is little more than a dud. The silliness and excitement are there for younger audiences, but the film lacks heart.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the main problems with the Despicable Me movies is the tendency to pile on more characters just to add celebrity voices to the cast. This fourth movie is no exception. While the addition of new characters can sometimes breathe fresh life into a franchise, here it feels like a missed opportunity to develop a more heartfelt story. For instance, the introduction of a new, younger female character named Poppy as a heist partner for Gru could have been a chance to add depth. However, it might have been more impactful to see Gru partnering with his oldest daughter, who is now a teenager. This would have added a layer of connection and growth between Gru and his daughter, showcasing his evolving role as a father.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe film also introduces a subplot where some Minions are turned into a superhero team, only to be used in the movie for less than 10 minutes. This subplot feels like a wasted narrative thread that could have added excitement and depth to the story. Additionally, one of the main Minions, Ralph, is stuck on a vending machine for the entirety of the movie, reducing his role to a mere gag. This sidelining of key characters in favor of introducing new ones dilutes the emotional core that could have made the story more engaging. \\r\\n\\r\\nWhile my son enjoyed the movie, which makes sense for his age range, it’s important for these films to also entertain the parents who are watching with their children. The earlier movies in the franchise managed to strike a balance between humor for kids and clever moments for adults. This installment, however, feels more like a series of gags strung together rather than a cohesive story with emotional weight.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf there are more films in the Despicable Me series, I believe it’s time to hang it up. However, if the franchise continues, I will wait for streaming to watch them because I am not interested in seeing them in theaters. The magic that made the original films entertaining for a broad audience seems to have faded, and without a significant shift in storytelling, future installments are likely to feel just as lackluster.\",\n",

       "  'Australian animator and filmmaker Adam Elliot’s last full-length feature film was Mary and Max (2009). Memoir of a Snail is narrated and told from the point of view of Grace Pudel (Sarah Snook). Grace details her life story that finds humor and sentimentality in the face of depression, shortcomings, and letdowns.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are two people in the world that Grace feels comfortable with: her twin brother Gilbert (Kodi Smit-McPhee) and her best friend Pinky (Jacki Weaver). Their mother died during childbirth and their father is a drunk paraplegic who is a former street performer and animator from France. Grace developed the desire to be an animator while Gilbert wants to be a street performer.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter their father passes away, the twins are separated and put into foster homes in two separate states. They spend the majority of the film writing letters to one another and dreaming of the day that they can reunite.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs an adult, Grace meets Pinky. Pinky wears giant, red-rim glasses, is covered in wrinkles and liver spots, and habitually smokes cigars. She has traveled all over the world, met countless people, been with only a handful of memorable men, and has lived a crazy life full of no regrets or dull moments. She quickly becomes Grace’s best friend.\\r\\n\\r\\nGrace becomes obsessed with snails at a young age. She keeps live ones as pets in a jar and buys every snail-related knickknack she can get her hands on. She also likes to read trashy romance novels and is constantly eating Chiko Rolls, which are spring rolls that are the size of burritos.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you haven’t seen Mary and Max or his 2003 Academy Award-winning short Harvie Krumpet, Adam Elliot’s stop-motion animated style isn’t as smooth and polished as recent Laika or Aardman films have become. Elliot’s stop-motion still looks like it was hand-crafted by humans – visible balls of clay that have been molded into these soul-driven characters that we eventually grow to love.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt would have been extremely easy for Adam Elliot to make Memoir of a Snail into a film that emotionally destroys the audience and never looks back. However, the film is written in a way that makes you feel an entire spectrum of emotions over a mere 90 minutes.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnyone who grew up as a loner will sympathize with Grace, especially when devoting your life to collecting something you love. But her story is presented in a way that allows you to laugh at all the terrible things in her life. The characters in the film, no matter how much screen time they’re given, are loaded with eccentricities.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere’s a bum who lost his job as a court judge because he liked to masturbate in court, the foster family Gilbert is sent to is a wildly religious one complete with gibberish prayers and apple worshipping, and Grace falls in love with a man in the neighborhood while he’s using his leaf blower.\\r\\n\\r\\nSurprisingly, Memoir of a Snail is R-rated. There’s some mild vulgarity in there and repeated use of the middle finger, but there’s also a shocking amount of nudity. Grace’s foster family has this boring front of designing traffic lights. They create awards for her every week and hang them on her wall to get her to stop being sad about being separated from her brother. But they’re also swingers who like to take exotic vacations purely driven based on having sex with new people in a new place.\\r\\n\\r\\nMemoir of a Snail is an animated film that is as enjoyable on an emotional level as a thought-provoking one. The film has several life lessons that stick with you afterward. Grace, Gilbert, and their father all wrestle with feeling caged in throughout the film, but the difference is who feels like a glass half full, a glass half empty, and just a glass.\\r\\n\\r\\nMade on a rapid 32-week shooting schedule where animators had to complete 10 seconds a day to finish on time, Memoir of a Snail is a small-budget animated film that feels like a handmade labor of love. \\r\\n\\r\\nIt’s a film that honors weird people no matter how bizarre they may be. Next to its superb writing and ability to make you laugh while ripping your heartstrings to shreds, that is what makes it so beautiful and memorable.'],\n",

       " ['**Trailblazers of a Lost Art**\\r\\n\\r\\nLittle wonder James Cameron and Joss Whelon movies are the biggest box-office earners. They are masters of cinematic rhetoric. The unfolding dramatic situations and controlled dialogue are meticulously contrived. Cameron could probably have potted more if it wasn\\'t for his earnest, simplistic messages (rich bad; nature good). All three movies (_Titanic_, _Avatar_, _Avengers_) plot along comfortably then suddenly spike spectacularly.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut no one has ever laid on the cinematic charm and cajolery like Stephen Spielberg. He was by far the craftiest manipulator of action and melodrama there ever was. He was the progenitor of summer blockbusters and all-ages, all-nations spectacles. At his best he had a gift for re-living and realizing that ethereal and irresistible childhood awe.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf _Raiders of the Lost Ark_ (NOT the sequels... NO, not even the father- son one) was made today, exactly the same way, okay maybe in 3D with updated CGI, it would surely land at the top of the box-office heap. It is essentially the first comic book movie that wasn\\'t a comic book (bespectacled mild-mannered Archaeology prof by day and globe-trotting whip-wielding action hero on sabbatical). _Raiders of the Lost Ark_ (the first and only) is arguably the greatest adventure movie ever cooked up. And we, the abject audience, servile participants of the artifice, were licking its boots. We wanted Spielberg and his Indy to rope us in, reel us into the action, and completely have their way with us. We overlooked the emotional manipulation and contrived trappings because it was a pure freaking joy to watch, a Lucas produced godsend. Harrison Ford was born to play it just as Steven was born to direct it. It\\'s really too bad they had to brand and knock off inferior sequels that, while making oodles of money, tarnished the shine of the unsurpassed prototype.\\r\\n\\r\\nIndiana Jones was the perfect reluctant action hero on a selfless mission. A whip-snapping, truck-wrangling, swordster-gunning, Nazi- brawling adventurer who was matched only by his headstrong and sassy love interest, one pistol of a gal who could drink any man under the table. Not enough credit has been given to the great Lawrence Kasdan as the writer of this marvellous adventure. The script is as close to perfect as anybody could scribe. Even a dialogue-heavy expository scene (poisoned dates) was infused with a tense element of suspense. Yes, the story was hyper-fictional, completely contrived, shamelessly far-fetched... and altogether delightful. I wasn\\'t expecting much when I went in to watch it back in 1981, but it had me wanting to do do back-flips on the way out. America\\'s own Fab Four, Larry, Steve, Harrison and George, put on an action-adventure clinic.\\r\\n\\r\\nPossibly the only weak spot in the movie is the climax which had our hero and heroine tied to a stake while God, the almighty Mcguffin from the Old Testament, magically wrapped things up for them. \"Don\\'t look\" Indy warns, with his patented crooked grin. Are you kidding? We can\\'t possibly take out eyes off of this. With respect to lost Teddy Bears from space and anti-Nazi machinators, Raiders is Spielbergs greatest achievement. It is one of the finest films ever made, of its or any kind. It is, hands down, my desert island movie.',\n",
       "  \"I think for a lot of people, Raiders is their favourite (x) movie. Be that their favourite adventure movie, favourite '80s movie, favourite Spielberg movie, whatever. None of those ring true for me, but it is my favourite Indiana Jones movie. I was a mad fiend for Temple of Doom as a kid, and I've managed to make multiple teachers put The Last Crusade on in class, so I'm quite a fan of the franchise, but Raiders is the most enjoyable to me... I've never even seen Crystal Skull... So maybe it's dishonest to say I'm a fan of the franchise... I'm a fan of the trilogy!\\r\\n\\r\\n_Final rating:★★★½ - I really liked it.

I'm sure they were all the rage once upon a time as a classic villain, but it doesn't do much for me.\\r\\n\\r\\nHarrison Ford, of course, carries the movie, but Karen Allen plays really well with him throughout the movie and is amazing in her own right.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf nothing else, Spielberg is able to shoot a powerful atmosphere, and the movie is captivating and engaging.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt's not something I can watch over and over, but when I do watch it I know I'm going to get drawn in and have a great time.\",\n",

Harrison Ford is engaging and hugely charismatic and his battles with Karen Allen and Paul Freeman make for a considered, slightly dark but funny and memorable piece of cinema. So many great films have a depth in the cast that offers a multi-layered approach to storytelling. Spielberg cast John Rhys-Davies and Denholm Elliott excellently as Ford's stalwarts. John Williams has a golden baton when it comes to action-scores (akin to Korngold) and the story clearly has a tint of George Lucas' imagination to it. Historically, there is plenty of fiction but that spoils nothing. Not the best of the series, but a very good start...\"],\n",

       "  \"There are so many movies within the Despicable Me franchise that I've lost count of all the storylines in each. While I've never been a big fan of these movies, they at least always felt exciting. However, this fourth installment in the Gru storyline is little more than a dud. The silliness and excitement are there for younger audiences, but the film lacks heart.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the main problems with the Despicable Me movies is the tendency to pile on more characters just to add celebrity voices to the cast. This fourth movie is no exception. While the addition of new characters can sometimes breathe fresh life into a franchise, here it feels like a missed opportunity to develop a more heartfelt story. For instance, the introduction of a new, younger female character named Poppy as a heist partner for Gru could have been a chance to add depth. However, it might have been more impactful to see Gru partnering with his oldest daughter, who is now a teenager. This would have added a layer of connection and growth between Gru and his daughter, showcasing his evolving role as a father.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe film also introduces a subplot where some Minions are turned into a superhero team, only to be used in the movie for less than 10 minutes. This subplot feels like a wasted narrative thread that could have added excitement and depth to the story. Additionally, one of the main Minions, Ralph, is stuck on a vending machine for the entirety of the movie, reducing his role to a mere gag. This sidelining of key characters in favor of introducing new ones dilutes the emotional core that could have made the story more engaging. \\r\\n\\r\\nWhile my son enjoyed the movie, which makes sense for his age range, it’s important for these films to also entertain the parents who are watching with their children. The earlier movies in the franchise managed to strike a balance between humor for kids and clever moments for adults. This installment, however, feels more like a series of gags strung together rather than a cohesive story with emotional weight.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf there are more films in the Despicable Me series, I believe it’s time to hang it up. However, if the franchise continues, I will wait for streaming to watch them because I am not interested in seeing them in theaters. The magic that made the original films entertaining for a broad audience seems to have faded, and without a significant shift in storytelling, future installments are likely to feel just as lackluster.\",\n",

Better safe than sorry, \"Silas\" relocates the family to a safe house where they have to pretend to fit in with the vacuous tennis club set, but one of that number - the feisty \"Poppy\" knows the secret and blackmails \"Gru\" into helping her pinch \"Lenny\" the badger from under the eyes of the diminutive \"Principal Übelschlecht\" at his alma mater. This adventure narks the headmistress and when she sees some video of the perpetrators, she\\'s straight on to the phone with \"Maxime\" who hatches a plan to steal the baby and give him wings! The minions - and the newly formed and enhanced \"Super Minions\" - still manage to have some fun here as they discover their new home has a vending machine and an endless supply of popcorn, and there is some wit in the dialogue but the story itself is all pretty derivative and the animation looks a little too tired now.

       "  'Sometimes the simplest yet most profound messages we can receive come from the unlikeliest of sources. So it is with the second animated feature from writer-director Gints Zilbalodis, a stunningly beautiful, inspiringly insightful odyssey about a band of animals seeking to find their way and survive in a new world. When a great flood essentially destroys the world of man, a wide-eyed black cat must figure out how to get by when this consuming deluge wipes out the existence he has known, armed with only his own wits and the cooperation of fellow animal kindreds, including a capybara, a meerkat, a secretary bird and a pack of dogs, most notably a yellow Labrador retriever. Together this band of different creatures navigates the waters of this new world in an abandoned sailboat, learning how to work together to support one another and to stay alive, surmounting an array of challenges along the way. In the process, they collectively learn valuable life lessons that we as humans can all stand to follow, especially when confronted with circumstances not unlike those that we all must contend with in a world on the edge, conditions to which most of us can probably relate these days. The answers that these creatures come up with are often patently obvious, but the film thoughtfully prompts us to ask ourselves that, if these simple solutions are so readily apparent, why aren’t we doing more ourselves to embrace them in addressing our own current challenges? That’s a very good question and one of the greatest strengths of this widely acclaimed release. This dialogue-free offering, whose only sounds come from the authentic utterances of its animal protagonists and its emotive background score, features exquisite animation in its depiction of a world in transition, one showing the remnants of what’s been left behind and the emergence of what’s coming into being. While the narrative takes a little time to initially find its footing and is occasionally episodic as it unfolds, the various incidents it portrays as the story plays out are instructive, touching, meaningful and spot on in conveying the picture’s myriad insights, crafted in a way that shows more than tells and successfully avoids the temptation to spoon-feed audiences. “Flow” may be animated, but it’s by no means a cartoon, an accomplishment to which more films in this genre should attempt to aspire. This Golden Globe Award winner and Oscar nominee for best animated feature is a true gem, one from which we could all stand to learn a lot – and, one would hope, before we’re faced with circumstances like these ourselves.'],\n",

They spend the majority of the film writing letters to one another and dreaming of the day that they can reunite.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs an adult, Grace meets Pinky. Pinky wears giant, red-rim glasses, is covered in wrinkles and liver spots, and habitually smokes cigars. She has traveled all over the world, met countless people, been with only a handful of memorable men, and has lived a crazy life full of no regrets or dull moments. She quickly becomes Grace’s best friend.\\r\\n\\r\\nGrace becomes obsessed with snails at a young age. She keeps live ones as pets in a jar and buys every snail-related knickknack she can get her hands on. She also likes to read trashy romance novels and is constantly eating Chiko Rolls, which are spring rolls that are the size of burritos.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you haven’t seen Mary and Max or his 2003 Academy Award-winning short Harvie Krumpet, Adam Elliot’s stop-motion animated style isn’t as smooth and polished as recent Laika or Aardman films have become. Elliot’s stop-motion still looks like it was hand-crafted by humans – visible balls of clay that have been molded into these soul-driven characters that we eventually grow to love.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt would have been extremely easy for Adam Elliot to make Memoir of a Snail into a film that emotionally destroys the audience and never looks back. However, the film is written in a way that makes you feel an entire spectrum of emotions over a mere 90 minutes.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnyone who grew up as a loner will sympathize with Grace, especially when devoting your life to collecting something you love. But her story is presented in a way that allows you to laugh at all the terrible things in her life. The characters in the film, no matter how much screen time they’re given, are loaded with eccentricities.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere’s a bum who lost his job as a court judge because he liked to masturbate in court, the foster family Gilbert is sent to is a wildly religious one complete with gibberish prayers and apple worshipping, and Grace falls in love with a man in the neighborhood while he’s using his leaf blower.\\r\\n\\r\\nSurprisingly, Memoir of a Snail is R-rated. There’s some mild vulgarity in there and repeated use of the middle finger, but there’s also a shocking amount of nudity. Grace’s foster family has this boring front of designing traffic lights. They create awards for her every week and hang them on her wall to get her to stop being sad about being separated from her brother. But they’re also swingers who like to take exotic vacations purely driven based on having sex with new people in a new place.\\r\\n\\r\\nMemoir of a Snail is an animated film that is as enjoyable on an emotional level as a thought-provoking one. The film has several life lessons that stick with you afterward. Grace, Gilbert, and their father all wrestle with feeling caged in throughout the film, but the difference is who feels like a glass half full, a glass half empty, and just a glass.\\r\\n\\r\\nMade on a rapid 32-week shooting schedule where animators had to complete 10 seconds a day to finish on time, Memoir of a Snail is a small-budget animated film that feels like a handmade labor of love. \\r\\n\\r\\nIt’s a film that honors weird people no matter how bizarre they may be. Next to its superb writing and ability to make you laugh while ripping your heartstrings to shreds, that is what makes it so beautiful and memorable.'],\n",

       " ['There\\'s something about the use of the monkey to characterise Robbie Williams that makes this quite a visceral watch at times. The film tells the story of the fairly turbulent rise of this \"Take That\" singer from boyhood exponent of Gilbert and Sullivan to a man on the right end of an £80 millions record deal. His dad (Steve Pemberton) went off to a football match whilst he was a child and never came back, and that left him with his mum \"Janet\" (Kate Mulvany) and adoring nan (Alison Steadman) living a pretty much hand to mouth existence and leaving him with a pretty solid foundation for his later emotional and trust issues. Unless you\\'ve lived on the moon these last twenty years, then you\\'ll know much of what happens next. What does make this stand out a little more is the fact that Williams himself is behind the project and is in no way afraid to portray himself as a complete ass. His drink, drugs, tantrums and generally spoilt brattishness are laid bare with little, if any, attempt to sanitise. In some ways it reminded me of the recent \"Amy\" biopic and came hot on the heels of a recent viewing of \"Easter Parade\" (1948) with both serving, for completely different reasons, to augment the thrust of this story of a person who attained great stardom, success and wealth - and ultimately ended up with addictions galore and few, real, friends amidst a sea of hangers-on and parasites all too eager to selfishly cash in on the fame of a lad who started aged just fifteen. Of course it\\'s not exactly balanced, and I\\'m sure the gospel according to Robbie might not be quite how others see their own behaviour (or his) but there is an honesty to this that brings home just how ruthless the music business is and at just how fickle fame can be when those we idolise lose their lustre. It doesn\\'t do it any harm that many of his solo songs work well through big screen audio with some classy string arrangements and powerful vocals to remind us that, unlike many of the largely forgotten \"Take That\" singles, his music - especially the stuff he made with Guy Chambers - is the stuff we will really long remember. It\\'s not for the faint hearted, but still well worth a watch.'],\n",

Directed by Kelsey Mann, the film revisits Riley as she navigates the complexities of teenage life, with her emotions—Joy, Sadness, Anger, Fear, and Disgust—returning to guide her. The movie introduces new emotions, adding fresh dynamics and challenges. The animation is vibrant and expressive, capturing the nuanced portrayal of inner emotional worlds. With its clever storytelling, humor, and poignant moments, \"Inside Out 2\" resonates deeply with audiences, offering a thoughtful exploration of growing up and emotional resilience.',\n",

       "  'I really quite enjoyed the first of these (2015) but I struggled a bit to stay engaged with the one. \"Riley\" is still happily coasting through family life until one day, she embarks on the yellow brick road that is puberty. Towit, her control gallery is no longer the purview of just her lifelong guides like \"Fear\", \"Joy\" and \"Anger\" - now she has also to deal with the likes of disgust, envy, boredom and worst of all - anxiety. It\\'s maybe the latter that the film should be called as we now embark on quite a humourless swipe at the culture of validation that young people must navigate. It\\'s all about being popular. Being liked. Being the best - in the ice hockey team. Old loyalties go under the bus in favour of new aspirations and yes, much of it does ring quite true as an evaluation of the fickleness in all of us. Thing is, though, there\\'s just too much inevitability about what comes next and there\\'s way too much incessant dialogue. \"Anger\" has some fun along the way, and there is the odd comedy one-liner from the laconic \"Ennui\" but it just didn\\'t resonate with me at all. The animation is standard Pixar fayre that does the job colourfully but unremarkably, and by the conclusion I was hoping there was an off button on that great big console. Yep - I\\'m probably too old to really appreciate this the way the kids can, but the trick for these studios has to be to engage the adults at the same time as the weans, else out come the mobile phones as our own version of ennui sets in.

       "  '_Inside Out 2_ is a harmless sequel that is fun for all ages but also absolutely unnecessary. The film recycles three-quarters of the original while introducing a quarter of new characters and ideas.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Full review:** https://bit.ly/PixarClone',\n",
       "  \"Poor Pixar! They just haven't been able to catch a break this decade! Having a majority of their originals dumbed on Disney+, Lightyear flopping, and Elemental just barely managing to make a comeback after having the studio's worst opening yet. They just can't catch a break, specially with Disney laying off their animators and refusing to let them make any originals anymore. Safe to say, they've had it rough! But Inside Out 2, despite many things working against it actually managed to be good, in fact great! Almost as good as its predecessor. I'm not gonna fully say it's a masterpiece like any of their older films, or even films like Soul or the first Inside Out, but it's still a pretty great movie! A movie that honors the original while adding to the original's themes. Instead of just being the first movie again, they actually do things a little different, by adding new emotions, covering the themes of puberty and anxiety, and adding some new locations. I also like how they don't just reset Joy back to the way she was in movie 1, they actually stick to her character development, letting the others help her, especially Sadness, and being open to new ideas. She's still flawed, of course, but it's more still growing as a character rather than just learning the same lesson again. They even subvert the originals message. Inside Out 1: it's okay to not be happy. Inside Out 2: It's okay to let happiness in. You are valued and you are good enough. There's also one scene in the movie : the panic attack. I won't spoil what happens but I really love how this scene played out. Altogether, a pretty solid film that builds on the original ti the point where I'd actually say I'd be open for a 3rd movie, something I thought I'd never, ever say ever!!! Congrats, Pix! U made a good sequel, keep it up!\\r\\n\\r\\n           TOTAL SCORE: 8.5/10\",\n",
       "  'This movie is not bad at all. they left to open to more movies and I am good with that they kids haven’t a good franchise since toy store movies so ya I hope they keep making them!!',\n",
       "  \"When I first heard about the sequel to Inside Out, I approached it with a mix of excitement and apprehension. The original film is a masterpiece, one of Pixar’s finest achievements, seamlessly blending humor, emotion, and a profound understanding of human psychology. Given Pixar’s recent uneven track record, I feared that the sequel might not live up to the high standards set by its predecessor. However, I am delighted to report that isn't the case here.\\r\\n\\r\\nI can confidently say that Inside Out 2 is a worthy successor to the original. It almost reaches the same level of excellence, taking the story in a fresh direction with a new cast of characters that enrich the narrative.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sequel introduces a beautifully nuanced character: Anxiety, portrayed by Maya Hawke. Hawke’s performance brings a sympathetic depth to the role, making Anxiety a character that audiences can relate to and care for. The character adds a layer of complexity to the story that resonates on multiple levels. Anxiety's interactions with Joy, played masterfully once again by Amy Poehler, highlight the inevitable struggles of growing up. Poehler’s Joy continues to be the heart of the film.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe story’s emotional core remains as powerful as ever. As a father, the original film spoke to me deeply about understanding and acknowledging my children's emotions all by extension. This sequel shifts the focus inward, reflecting the internal emotional landscape of adolescence and early adulthood. Riley, our protagonist, is growing up, and the introduction of more complex emotions reflects the reality of her development. The film brilliantly captures the awkwardness and discomfort of this transition, making it relatable for both younger audiences and adults.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome interactions in the film are cringe-worthy because they are so true to life. We've all experienced moments of anxiety and self-doubt, and seeing them portrayed so authentically on screen is both uncomfortable and cathartic. \\r\\n\\r\\nAmy Poehler's portrayal of Joy remains a highlight, and Maya Hawke’s Anxiety is a beautifully crafted antagonist who evolves throughout the film. By the end, Anxiety isn’t just a source of conflict but a character that facilitates growth and understanding. This development adds depth to the narrative, making it more than just a children’s film but a profound exploration of emotional growth.\\r\\n\\r\\nInside Out 2 is a summer movie that stands as a high point for family entertainment. It balances humor and emotion with a storyline that speaks to both children and adults. Pixar has once again delivered a film that not only entertains but also enlightens, reminding us of the importance of understanding and embracing all our emotions. For anyone who loved the first film, this sequel is a must-watch, capturing the same magic while exploring new emotional territory.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you cherished the original for its insightful portrayal of emotions, you will find Inside Out 2 a worthy and enriching continuation of Riley’s journey. It’s a film that promises to be both a hit with families and a valuable conversation starter about the complex world of emotions.\",\n",
       "  '\"Inside Out 2\" brilliantly follows up its predecessor with a heartwarming and deeply insightful exploration of the human mind. Directed by Pete Docter and produced by Pixar Animation Studios, this sequel delves even deeper into the complexities of emotions, creating a movie that is as intellectually stimulating as it is emotionally resonant.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe film continues the story of Riley, now a teenager, navigating the tumultuous waters of adolescence. The return of our beloved emotions—Joy, Sadness, Anger, Fear, and Disgust—offers a delightful reunion while introducing new emotional characters that reflect the evolving complexity of Riley\\'s inner world. Each emotion is beautifully voiced, bringing authenticity and depth to their characters. Amy Poehler’s Joy and Phyllis Smith’s Sadness once again shine, their dynamic evolving in ways that are both surprising and deeply moving.',\n",
       "  'Inside Out 2 is a suggestion to follow Riley’s troubles during adolescence, which adds new characters to this animated movie – Anxiety and Envy, – besides Joy, Sadness, Anger, Fear, and Disgust. Both animation and voice acting are great, and the animation properly shows the confusion and disorder of a teenage girl’s mind. Compared to ‘Toy Story 2,’ it may not be as rich in genuine sentiment, but it returns all viewers, children, and adults, to the challenge of the act of growing up.\\r\\n\\r\\nI also enjoyed the comedy and the themes present in it and maybe because of the continuous showings or better comprehension of it allowed me to have less of a feeling compare to the first one although at some parts it is sort of teary. It was interesting to see how Joy and Anxiety interacted with each other these characters are more real in terms of showing us how emotions work during decision-making when you’re in trouble.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you enjoyed my experience, check out the <a href=\"https://moviepoptime.com/drama/inside-out-2/\" target=\"_blank\">Latest Movie Reviews</a>.'],\n",

       " ['We’re all familiar with the old adage that, if something seems too good to be true, it probably is. It’s a notion that applies not only to what can happen in everyday life, but also to what shows up on the big screen, as the latest feature from writer-director Sean Baker illustrates. This widely acclaimed indie offering follows the misadventures of a Brooklyn lap dancer/sex worker (Mikey Madison) who falls for the insanely rich, self-absorbed, wildly irresponsible son of a Russian oligarch (Mark Eydelshteyn). Together they take the plunge into an edgy, wacked-out fairy tale, a dark storybook romance strung out on steroids, quaaludes and crack. Their whirlwind affair soon lands them in Las Vegas, culminating in a green card wedding that junior’s mobster parents (Darya Ekamasova, Aleksey Serebryakov) want annulled at any cost, even if it means calling on their oily, bumbling posse of cronies and heavies (Karren Karagulian, Vache Tovmasyan, Yura Borisov) to lean on the alleged lovebirds. But achieving that goal ultimately proves more difficult than imagined. As a cross-country chase ensues, a string of frenzied events leaves mom, dad and friends infuriated and the Gothamite Cinderella disillusioned, having erroneously thought she’d truly hit the jackpot this time. From this, one might easily think this premise has a solid foundation for an outrageous, uproarious comedy, but, sadly, the film lives up to its potential only some of the time. To be sure, there is some genuinely hysterical, wonderfully inventive material here, but it only hits the mark about half the time. What’s more, much of the story (especially in the film’s first half) is predictable, almost clichéd, with some bits dragging on needlessly long. Indeed, I’m somewhat mystified as to what all the critical fuss is about, something perhaps best evidenced by the picture’s capture of the Palme d’Or at this year’s Cannes Film Festival, the event’s highest honor. I readily admit to being a fan of Baker’s work, having immensely enjoyed his previous efforts “Red Rocket” (2021), “The Florida Project” (2017) and “Tangerine” (2015). But I’m genuinely at a loss to understand the level of praise that’s been lavished on this release. It’s a capable film in a number of respects, but the filmmaker clearly has done better, and those prior offerings make better viewing options in my opinion. Don’t fall for all the hype here, as this really is one of those cases of something being too good to be true.',\n",
       "  '\"Ani\" (Mikey Madison) works as a private dancer in New York when she is asked by her boss to go look after some visiting Russians. That\\'s when she encounters the young \"Vanya\" (Mark Eydelshteyn). He\\'s pretty drunk, completely stoned and has more money than God. He wants a dance, he wants much more - but that\\'s not allowed in the club, so he invites her to his luxury pad next day for fun. She actually quite likes his youthful exuberance - and his cash - and after a few days, a Russian sable coat, and a trip to Vegas, they find themselves marred. Social media now takes an hand and his oligarch mother hears news that her son has married an hooker. Livid, she instructs her local fixer \"Toros\" (Karren Karagulian) to sort the mess out. He duly sends his two enforcers to the house where all hell promptly breaks loose. \"Garnick\" (Vache Tovmasyan) and \"Tom\" (Anton Bitter) are merely to detain the pair until their boss arrives to insist that marriage is going to be annulled; \"Ani\" is having none of that and \"Vanya\" - well he\\'s just a little bit conflicted and quickly things start to go pear-shaped! This film starts off strongly with an entertaining courtship scenario played out between two actors who really do look like they are enjoying themselves. Eydelshteyn delivers enthusiastically and acrobatically, there\\'s loads of sex and quite witty dialogue that plays nicely on the language barriers. Once the second phase of the film starts, though, it runs out of steam a little. \"Vanya\" doesn\\'t feature so much and the story becomes a little less engaging as the rather too gentle thugs and the increasingly irate girl try to get everyone to the courthouse for the ruling before his angry mother arrives. That leaves us with too much overacting from Karagulian and some increasingly implausible scenarios as the air is gradually let out of the thing and it comes to end rather disappointingly. At it\\'s best, though, the first hour is quickly paced and takes an amiable swipe at the sex trade and the players who make and take from it. Certainly worth a watch, it just hasn\\'t quite the courage of it\\'s initial convictions.',\n",
       "  \"Anora is a film that starts off strong, pulling you in with an intriguing setup and a well-paced first act. It follows a story that keeps you invested, blending drama with some unexpected humor. The second act stretches a bit longer than needed, but it's clear that was intentional to build atmosphere and let certain themes play out. While the pacing is deliberate, it sometimes feels like it's lingering in places that don't add much depth to the characters. That being said, the buildup is engaging, even if the payoff leaves something to be desired.\\r\\n\\r\\nSean Baker's directing is solid, capturing a raw, almost documentary-like feel that makes the film feel real and immersive. He knows how to make everyday settings feel alive and uses long takes effectively. The cinematography complements this, keeping things grounded with natural lighting and handheld shots that add an almost voyeuristic feel to the story. It’s visually well-crafted, even if it doesn’t aim for anything particularly stylized. The way the camera lingers on certain moments adds weight to the film's themes, even when the script doesn’t fully explore them.\\r\\n\\r\\nMikey Madison delivers a standout performance, carrying much of the film. She brings a layered energy to the role, making her character feel both confident and vulnerable when needed. The supporting cast does their job well, but the script doesn't give them much depth to work with. That’s one of the film’s weaknesses, while it sets up an interesting premise and characters, it doesn’t fully flesh them out. You get a sense of their motivations, but not much beyond that. The dialogue is sharp in some moments but feels underdeveloped in others, leaving certain interactions feeling a bit hollow.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe score and sound design are subtle, used more for atmosphere than standout moments. The film relies heavily on natural sounds and ambient noise, which works well for its grounded approach. It enhances the realism but doesn't do much to elevate the emotions of the film. \\r\\n\\r\\nOverall, Anora is a well-directed and well-acted film that keeps you engaged, but it doesn’t quite stick the landing. If you’re looking for a character-driven story with a raw, unfiltered feel, it’s worth a watch, but don’t expect a big payoff in the end.\"],\n",

And after the first viewing you immediately understand why.\\r\\nIt pushes the boundaries of sensuality, sex, sound, ambition, morality and feminism.\\r\\nAll this is possible thanks to a captivating Nicole Kidman, an intimate script and direction by Halina Reijn and a production by A24, which as always never disappoints.\",\n",
       "  'Business executive \"Romy\" (Nicole Kidman) is initially impressed with the dog-handling skills of \"Samuel\" (Harris Dickinson) but when she discovers that he is to be an intern in her e-packaging company something else starts to draw her to the man. We already know that though happily enough married to \"Jacob\" (Antonio Banderas) she\\'s not exactly fulfilled in the bedroom department, and \"Samuel\" seems to sense that it\\'s an area that maybe he can help with. Were not just talking sex, here - oh. no. This is about a lady with fantasy of being dominated. About her surrendering control completely, and if you\\'re going to do that at all, then why not this tall, handsome and mischievous bit of rough? Of course, like any addiction - it starts to get out of control as the relationship dynamic changes quite profoundly and others start to put two and two together. At times this is quite funny, and milk seems to play a central role from time to time, but as a cinematic version of something akin to tantric, it doesn\\'t really work. Neither of these actors are afraid to get naked yet neither do, simultaneously, here. Indeed I\\'m sure I saw his black Calvin\\'s shining from under the sheet when the intimacy consultant was at their busiest. I didn\\'t need nudity to augment their unique sort of passion, but I did expect something way more natural, visceral even, and I didn\\'t get it. It\\'s filmed in such a disjointed and bitty fashion, there\\'s no attempt to characterise or contextualise either of these people and in the end I felt like this was little better than a titillation for it\\'s stars that didn\\'t really aspire to engage those watching any more than age-related porn might. Dickinson isn\\'t remotely charismatic and the premiss falls flat quickly, especially when the quite aggravating intervention of \"Esme\" (Sophie Wilde) rather summed the shallowness of the whole thing up. \"Eyes Wide Shut\" (1999) or \"Beach Rats\" (2017) showcase both their talents amidst a sexually charged environment far better: this is all forgettable, over-hyped, stuff.',\n",

Kudos for creativity, I guess!\\r\\n\\r\\nNicole Kidman and Harris Dickinson do commit to their respective roles, some of the noises coming out of the former were quite something to witness. In fairness, if this is what they were going for then both actors do a fine job. Antonio Banderas is at least there to add sort of normality.\\r\\n\\r\\nImpressively, aside from a few nips, there isn't much nudity in this, how you show so much without showing barely anything is actually quite the thing.

       "  'Babygirl (2024) is yet another attempt at making a “provocative” drama that leans too much on surface-level shock value rather than compelling storytelling. The plot, if you can call it that, revolves around an imbalanced relationship dynamic that lacks any real emotional depth. There is no real buildup, no effort to make the audience care about these characters beyond their physical interactions, and certainly no originality. The film tries to be daring, but instead, it feels like a predictable series of events with little payoff.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe directing is uninspired, relying on overused shaky cam techniques that have no business in a drama like this. The cinematography does nothing to elevate the story, and at times, it feels like the camera is as lost as the script. The only real standout performance comes from Antonio Banderas, but he’s barely in the movie. Nicole Kidman, despite her talent, is stuck in a role that feels more about aesthetics than substance. And of course, we have the usual over-the-top praise for a “bold sexualized performance,” the same kind of overhyped reaction we saw with Demi Moore in Substance, as if established actors being in explicit scenes somehow qualifies as groundbreaking cinema.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe script is painfully weak, with dialogue that does little to make the characters feel real or relatable. The film spends too much time trying to push a message without taking the time to craft an engaging narrative. There are moments where it seems like it might go somewhere interesting, but then it falls back into the same repetitive themes. The pacing is another issue, dragging through unnecessary moments while rushing past anything that could have added depth.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe score is outright annoying. It doesn’t complement the film or enhance any of the scenes, it’s just there, adding to the discomfort in all the wrong ways. In the end, Babygirl tries to be provocative but lacks the intelligence or creativity to make an impact. It’s the kind of movie that confuses shock value with substance, leaving you wondering what the point of it all was.'],\n",

       " [\"<em>'Alien: Romulus'</em> is actually very good.\\r\\n\\r\\nOf the more modern day releases from this franchise, this is the one I've enjoyed the most. When I was immediately coming out of the cinema I was just plainly thinking of it as being solidly good, however the more I think about it the more I had fun with this seventh installment.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe plot, or at least the set-up to it, is quite uncreative, as in I feel like so many films - from this series included - have a crew make-up of similar people and similar characteristics/motivations; <em>'Crater'</em> and <em>'I.S.S.'</em> (both very good, don't get me wrong) are recent examples that spring to mind. Happily, though, the rest of the flick makes up for any weakness in that area.\\r\\n\\r\\nCailee Spaeny and David Jonsson are the great performers in this, I found them both to be excellent throughout. Two actors I want to see much more of, having already seen them in a few pleasing pictures; e.g. <em>'Civil War'</em> and <em>'Rye Lane'</em>.\\r\\n\\r\\nI also liked the sound design and even the jump scares, which I'm not usually a fan of (bit lazy etc.) but there is enough about how they do them here that it works. Those facehuggers remain brilliantly effective, though the xenomorph isn't amazingly utilised - the human version didn't hit for me, felt <em>'I Am Legend'</em>-esque.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll in all, it's up there as one of my favourites from the franchise. For me, <em>'Alien'</em> and <em>'Aliens'</em> just narrowly better this, though it's a marginal improvement on (the entertaining) <em>'Alien Resurrection'</em> and it surpasses every other release, in my eyes.\",\n",
       "  'I gather director Fede Alvarez made a conscious - and probably expensive - decision to keep the use of CGI to a minimum here and it really does work. \"Rain\" (Cailee Spaeny) and her \"brother\" are looking to get off-planet but she can\\'t get travel papers from the all-powerful mining company. Desperate, she and \"Andy\" (David Jonsson) are offered a chance by wide boys \"Tyler\" (Archie Renaux) and \"Bjorn\" (Spike Fearn) to raid a decrepit old spacecraft that appears to be in a decaying orbit, so they can pinch it\\'s cryogenic pods and enable them all to escape to another planet out of reach of their enthralling taskmasters. Off they set onto the \"Romulus\" and that\\'s where, well you just know what\\'s going to happen now, as they inadvertently turn the central heating on and find themselves in mortal danger. \"Andy\" just happens to be a synthetic, which proves especially useful when they discover the remains of \"Rook\" (the spitting image of the late Sir Ian Holm) but is this oozing mess of gunge and wiring actually an help or an hindrance? Getting off is going to be a lot harder than getting on! To be honest, the acting here is really neither here nor there. Renaux and Isabella Merced - their cohort \"Kay\" do enough, Fearn rather over-plays his chip-on-the-shoulder character and there\\'s a slightly soporific effort from Jonsson, but that\\'s not what I was watching for. This is all about the best monsters sci-fi cinema has ever created, and right from their first appearance I was in their corner. There\\'s loads of darkly shot menace crammed into the two hours with plenty of references to it\\'s originator and even more insinuations about the greed of a \"company\" that doesn\\'t know when to leave well alone. Just like the other \"Alien\" films, it takes a Russian Doll approach to the ending, so don\\'t think we\\'re going to get off with just the one, definitive, \"get away from her...\" moment, and of course the lift plays a pivotal part in the proceedings as acid blood drips everywhere. It\\'s not so good as the first two Sigourney Weaver outings, but slips neatly into bronze medal position for me in a series that can still prove quite compellingly scary. It\\'s a cinema must - telly just won\\'t do the lighting and photography justice at all.',\n",
       "  'Whilst not as awful as the Aliens franchise films that came after the excellent first and second films, starring Sigourney Weaver, Alien Romulus is not without its shortcomings. \\r\\n\\r\\nWhats immediately noticeable, in spite of the rugged, industrial setting, is a cast that look like they just escaped from the set of Beverly Hills 90210. Youthful, fresh faced, physically unimposing, with not a grease stain or blemish in sight, they feel badly out of place. \\r\\n\\r\\nIf you can put the sense of disbelief regarding the casting aside (I couldn\\'t) the actual story fares only marginally better.

That said, haven\\'t we seen it all before, in one form or another? \\r\\n\\r\\nIn summary, miscasting combined with a story that blandly apes superior earlier films, leads to an \"okay\" watch that\\'s fails to distinguish itself.If you are new to this franchise, my advice start with Alien from 1979 and then its plural successor Aliens, instead.',\n",
       "  'Color me thoroughly surprised at how much I was delighted by “Alien: Romulus,” a highly creative, beautifully executed, pulse-pounding science fiction film from director Fede Alvarez. This sequel is a rare gem in the world of big budget franchise flicks because it not only respects its predecessors with thoughtfully well done homages, but also pushes the boundaries of the universe it inhabits with inventive set pieces and a plausible story. Fans of the series and the genre are in for a real treat.\\r\\n\\r\\nGoing back to the roots of the “Alien” franchise, the film tells the story of a group of young space colonizers (Cailee Spaeny, David Jonsson, Archie Renaux, Isabela Merced, Aileen Wu, and Spike Fearn)who are looking for a way out of their current situation as hard laborers on a sunless planet. While searching the universe, they encounter a decommissioned ship that has enough supplies to take them far, far away. Intent on scavenging, the group makes a risky voyage into space where they get far more than they bargained for: a face-to-face encounter with a terrifying life form from which they may have no hope of escape.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe strength of the story is also in its simplicity, and Alvarez uses swift pacing and straightforward character development to create an irresistible hook for audiences. He creates a crackerjack blend of suspense, horror, and science fiction that not only hearkens back to the original films, but also offers up something fresh and modernized for a new generation. Even better, the film is very dark and isn’t dumbed down for casual viewers, which shows a great deal of respect to long-time sci-fi fans. This isn’t just another sequel that is exploiting a franchise’s good will, it actually has some substance.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere’s an atmosphere of dread that commands most of the movie, and the action scenes are imaginative and inspired. I was on the edge of my seat multiple times, and several of the set pieces are visually fun, too. The special effects are not flashy or over-polished like the ones that tend to dominate modern blockbusters (even the alien creature itself remains largely unchanged from its original, iconic 1979 design), which turns out to be the perfect complement to the film’s strong narrative foundation. Heightened tension and fear is created through well-crafted suspense rather than constant visual bombardment. There’s a level of sophistication here that elevates it beyond a mere retread of past “Alien” films.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was especially surprised about how quickly I started to care about the characters, who don’t exactly give off the best first impression (they seem like they will be stereotypical and highly annoying, but that’s not the case). As the story unfolds, so do the layers of depth and complexity, both which make the fate of these friends matter. The film is well cast, and Spaeny’s versatility shines through in a role that requires both emotional range and physical intensity.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe film is willing to take risks, especially when it comes to killing off characters. The unpredictability of who will survive and who has the wits to escape from harrowing situations adds another layer of tension and sense of danger. Nothing here feels preordained, and that in itself is exciting.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Alien: Romulus” is a wildly satisfying addition to the franchise because it’s a film that understands what made the original great and uses those elements to create something new and exciting. It succeeds in paying homage to its predecessors while also forging its own identity, honoring its legacy in a way that will have sci-fi nerds salivating for future installments.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy: Louisa Moore / SCREEN ZEALOTS',\n",

       "  \"Alien: Romulus is a love letter to the 1979 classic, and while I dug the whole philosophical space-god thing in Prometheus, this stripped-down, back-to-basics approach had me hooked from the first frame.  It's been a while since an Alien film truly captured that sense of claustrophobic dread, and Romulus nails it.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis movie is gorgeous, plain and simple. The lighting, the camera angles, and Benjamin Wallfisch's score – it all blends together to create this constant tension that just sucks you in. There's this one scene where Rain, Andy and Tyler are being chased through the research station, the way they use the shadows and movement, it's like a masterclass in suspense. It totally reminded me of the most terrifying moments from the original. It's obvious Álvarez was obsessed with recreating that gritty, lived-in feel of the first Alien, and it pays off big time.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe cast is solid too. Cailee Spaeny and David Jonsson absolutely kill it as Rain and Andy.  I'll admit, I was worried Andy would be your typical forgettable sidekick, but he actually gets a pretty interesting arc.  Sure, most of the crew are basically there to get picked off by the Xenomorph, but Andy was a standout supporting character. He basically played two roles. It's refreshing that the movie doesn't waste time with a bunch of unnecessary characters.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne thing this movie does really well is finding that sweet spot between horror and action that made the first two films so iconic.  Alien 3 was so bleak, and Resurrection was just bonkers action – this one feels like a proper blend of both.  Fede Álvarez basically throws in all the best Alien tropes: the ragtag crew, the creepy body horror stuff, the tense hide-and-seek scenes, and some kickass action sequences. And you know what? It totally works.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was impressed at a lot of the creative set pieces and how they built tension. Like how they played with gravity to avoid the acid and trying to sneak past the facehuggers by camoflaging their body temperature. They were really cool and shockingly unique and fresh for a nearly 50 old franchise. And let's talk about that body horror. There's this one scene, a seriously messed-up vaginal birth, that is going to be burned into my brain for a while. Álvarez definitely gets what makes this franchise tick.\\r\\n\\r\\nI'm giving Alien: Romulus a strong 7/10.  It lost some points for the use of the CGI Ian Holm. It's so distracting, and they rely on it way too much.  Also, there some lines that were stuck in there for nostalgia that felt out of place.  But honestly, those are minor nitpicks in a movie that's this much fun. The whole final act, with the station crashing into the asteroid field and that epic showdown with the Human/ Xeno, is just pure chaos in the best way possible.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlien: Romulus is a worthy successor to the Alien throne. It's a visual treat, a thrilling ride, and a damn good reminder of why we love this franchise in the first place.\",\n",
       "  \"This was a great movie and a great continuation of Alien series. I think it deserves solid, perfect 10/10. I couldn't see any flow, everything was great.\",\n",
       "  'This is a great B-movie for people looking for a bit of a thrill.',\n",
       "  '**Maybe the best \"Alien\" movie after \"Aliens\", but at least as good as Prometheus (but in a different way)**\\r\\n\\r\\nI enjoyed this movie a lot. It didn\\'t try to be edgy or special - it seems to be directed by a guy who loved the first 2 Alien movies from the 80ies and wanted to add a movie as best as he could do in our time which is still faithful to those 2 original movies and could be considered a worthy addition to the original \"Alien\" storyline.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe acting was overall very good. Cailee Spaeny as the lead actress gave a solid performance as expected. But the surprise of the movie was David Jonsson as her android \"brother\", who was the highlight of the movie actingwise for me.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother main thing to mention are the effects and set desing. A lot of great practical effects, lighting and cinematography and the set design which is faithful to that of the first 2 Alien movies make this movie a great enjoyment for anyone who like the.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo, if you love the first 2 Alien movies - this movie is for you!',\n",
       "  '\"Alien: Romulus\" is a visually admirable film, but it really has nothing new to show us and even worse than that it has nothing fresh to say. It is merely content to plunder inspiration from the preceding films and the only entry in the series which appears to be left unplundered is \"Alien 3\" (1992), but then this omission can hardly be described as surprising. After all, it isn\\'t held in particularly high regard by the legions of loyal fans who absolutely adore these films for their often groundbreaking achievements and idolise the inexhaustible resourcefulness of Ellen Ripley. Unfortunately, these same loyal fans aren\\'t going to find anything worth adoring or idolising in this latest effort. It is still a reasonably entertaining motion picture, but only because you can spend most of the running time attempting to guess which scene comes from which film in order to appease your overwhelming sense of disappointment with it all.',\n",
       "  'The Alien franchise has had its ups and downs with mostly the latter in recent years. This latest one, which takes place in between Alien: Covenant and Alien in the timeline, is a solid entry from Fede Alvarez and is more in the vein of the first film in terms of look and tone. The story is pretty basic and no real twists that we haven\\'t seen before in the franchise, but I did like the lead actress Cailee Spaeny. The classic line, \"Getaway from her you bitch\" was delivered as great as Bale\\'s \"I\\'ll be back\" from Terminator Salvation (meaning not very well). Still, an all around entertaining sci-fi horror film that has great effects, both practical and CGI. **3.5/5**',\n",
       "  \"Fede Álvarez delivers a film in Alien: Romulus that tries to revitalize the franchise but stumbles on several key aspects. While visually appealing and faithful to the oppressive atmosphere characteristic of the saga, the movie lacks a solid narrative and memorable characters.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe script relies too heavily on genre clichés, with bland dialogue and unconvincing decisions from its protagonists. Attempts to explore philosophical themes about survival and human nature remain superficial, leaving the impression that the film tries to tackle more than it can handle.\\r\\n\\r\\nÁlvarez’s direction, which has shone in the past with more intimate horror projects, feels overwhelmed in such an established universe. The moments of tension and terror fail to achieve the desired impact, falling into an uneven rhythm that alternates between dull and predictable.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the most devoted fans of Alien, this installment is particularly disappointing. In an unfortunate parallel to Disney's mishandling of the Star Wars saga, Romulus feels like a production that prioritizes franchise formulas over true innovation or respect for the original spirit. Rather than expanding the Alien legacy, the film dilutes it, leaving a bitter aftertaste for fans who had expected much more.\\r\\n\\r\\nUltimately, Alien: Romulus fails to live up to its heritage, becoming a missed opportunity and a reminder that not all cinematic revivals are necessary.\"],\n",
       " ['In spite of a exciting trailer Apocalypse Z fails to deliver. \\r\\n\\r\\nPerhaps the most immediately noticeable negative is the tiresome need to play politics. An anti-Russian sentiment is front and centre, throughout a large chunk of this film.\\r\\n\\r\\nLooking beyond this, it takes far too long for what is essentially an action movie, akin to say \"World War Z\", to get off the ground. This film drags, at times, with sporadic moments of action, that never really amount to anything satisfying. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn summary, if more emphasis had been placed on crafting a compelling story rather than playing politics, this might have amounted to a decent film.Certainly the cast is strong and the acting\\'s excellent but on its own, its simply not enough. A mediocre watch, at best.'],\n",
       " ['The film adaptation of Wicked is based on the Broadway musical, which is a loose adaptation of the 1995 novel Wicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West by Gregory Maguire. Both Maguire’s novel and the musical are expansions of L. Frank Baum’s original The Wizard of Oz novel was published in 1900 and its film adaptation in 1939. The musical is one of the longest-running and financially successful Broadway musicals of all time.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith a screenplay by Winnie Holzman (writer of the book of the Wicked musical) and Dana Fox (Cruella) and directed by Jon M. Chu (Now You See Me 2, Crazy Rich Asians), Wicked begins around the time The Wizard of Oz ends. The Wicked Witch of the West has died and Glinda the Good Witch is breaking the news to Munchkinland. As the munchkins celebrate and burn a giant, Wicker Man-style witch in celebration of the witch’s death, Glinda is asked by one of the munchkins if she knew the witch.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat follows is nearly three hours of how a green-skinned, outcast girl named Elphaba (Cynthia Erivo) whose emotions spark wondrous fits of unbelievable magic interacts with the spoiled, entitled, and pink-infatuated Galinda (Ariana Grande) as they enroll in a magic school known as Shiz University.\\r\\n\\r\\nVisually, Wicked is jaw-dropping and beautiful. All of the talking animals look extraordinary and every sequence with the flying monkeys is a visual highlight. Peter Dinklage voices a goat teacher named Dr. Dillamond and he has one of the most emotional arcs in the film. The bear nurse and dog doctor in the opening moments of the film look so good for what little amount of screen time they have.\\r\\n\\r\\nGiven how many VFX teams are credited in the film, it’s no wonder the CGI looks intricately gorgeous. The three VFX teams with the most credits in Wicked include OPSIS (The Fall Guy, Rescue Rangers), Framestore (Gladiator II, Beetlejuice Beetlejuice), and ILM (Venom: The Last Dance, Alien: Romulus). Then there’s various work from about a dozen different other VFX teams/houses, but the most intriguing one is one called FoyProAI.\\r\\n\\r\\nFoyProAI doesn’t have an accessible official website, but some digging around on an executive producer’s LinkedIn page gives some background. Foy stands for Fountains of Youth and FoyProAI specializes in de-aging, up-aging, and beauty work in film. They’ve worked on Smile 2, John Woo’s The Killer for Peacock, and 400 shots on Wicked.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are moments of greatness in Wicked that mostly stem from the chemistry between Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande. Grande’s comedic roots, specifically her time and experience on SNL, really come into play here. Grande is essentially the comedic relief as Galinda as her outgoing personality carries most sequences while Erivo has more of a straightforward performance that has more of a dry delivery.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the generic musical formula is infuriating. Story beats pause and go out of their way to cater to multiple songs at times and it logically hurts your brain. Yes, it’s a musical and yes people are going to sing. But when the main characters are trying to get away on a flying broom as guards are pounding at the door and they spend another ten minutes dancing, crying, and bellowing about their broken friendship it becomes a nuisance. Get on the damn broom and sing on the way to your destination. It doesn’t seem that hard.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome sequences are thrown in solely because they’ll make a big song more appealing (the whole rotating library straight out of Inception thing) or side stories that don’t go anywhere because two characters need to seem closer than they are (Elphaba and Fiyero’s awkward ten-minute excursion into the forest to free a lion cub). These are both roundabout executions that take the long way to showcase that Fiyero thinks reading is dumb and that he’s actually in love with Elphaba over Galinda.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe film adaptation seems like it’s quite faithful to its source material, but the Hollywood concept of transforming nasty and recognizable villains into sad, relatable characters that the audience roots for is a dumpster fire of a concept. Pure asshole villains can be fantastic too and often make protagonists more interesting if done right.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the musical fantasy film treats Elphaba like dirt for the first hour and a half. Everyone looks down on her because of the color of her skin. Then when she finally becomes friends with Galinda, she develops a soft spot for mistreated animals. It’s the main reason she turns against The Wizard of Oz (Jeff Goldblum) apart from being one of the only characters who can read magic spells.\\r\\n\\r\\nWicked is Mean Girls at Hogwarts as everybody sucks and is superficial apart from a character that is supposed to be evil. Elphaba mostly accepts the role of wicked witch because her beliefs don’t match anyone else’s and she’s unwilling to adapt to their ways solely to keep the peace.\\r\\n\\r\\nWicked features some unreal VFX and even touches on some incredible ideas from time to time, but the ideas that work seem to stem from capitalizing on a fantasy world that was established over a century ago. As a film, Wicked conjures song after song and drags on and on solely because it’s a bloated musical that wants you to die a rhythmic, sometimes undecipherable, high-pitched death.',\n",
       "  '*THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS*\\r\\n\\r\\nI\\'ve been a Wicked fan since 2010. My expectations for this film were extremely high! And I was blown away by how Jon M. Chu was able to bring this story a new life. Everyone involved did an excellent job! The choice to sing live paid off! Not one note was out of tune! Bowen Yang & Bronwyn James were absolutely hilarious as Phannee & Shen Shen. Marissa Bode was fantastic as Nessarose. Can\\'t wait to see her story continue in Part 2. I hope they include \"Wicked Witch of the East\" in the Part 2 Soundtrack. Ethan Slater was great as Boq. I\\'m excited to see how he becomes the Tin Man in Part 2 because that\\'s not shown on stage. He transforms behind the cabinet but I hope we actually see it in Part 2. Michelle Yeoh was great in every scene as Madam Morrible. She was very Wicked! Jeff Goldblum was amazing as The Wizard! I loved the new version of The Grimmerie! The way it opened was very cool! Jonathan Bailey was incredibly charming as Fiyero! Dancing Through Life was very well choreographed and his singing was great! Loved the way he met Elphaba in this version. I\\'m very intrigued to see him become The Scarecrow in Part 2. Ariana Grande was absolutely phenomenal as Glinda! She embodied everything about Glinda! Loved her homages to past Glindas in Popular. Her voice was very Angelic. You can tell that she studied a lot for this role. Can\\'t wait to hear her \"I\\'m Not That Girl (Reprise)\". Cynthia Erivo stole the show as Elphaba Thropp. She poured her heart into this character! I\\'m so excited to hear \"No Good Deed\" in Part 2! She was incredible! As for the Cameos in One Short Day, Loved seeing Stephen Schwartz as The Guard & Winnie Holtzman as an Emerald City Resident. Love the expansion of the Wizomania show to include Kristin & Idina telling the story of The Grimmerie. Loved that Idina did her Elphie Battle Cry. It didn\\'t take away from Cynthia\\'s at the End. The Film was meant to happen in 2024. Had it come out in 2016 or 2019, I don\\'t think it would\\'ve been as well done as it was! I can\\'t wait to see Part 2 and how much of The Wizard of Oz they include. I hope we get to see Dorothy\\'s Face. 10/10 No Notes.',\n",
       "  'OK, so I\\'m going to be swimming against the tide a bit with this, but I didn\\'t love it. We start where the \"Wizard of Oz\" story finishes off, only without the catchy \"Ding Dong the Witch is...\". Instead we get an ensemble dance number that is energetically performed, colourful and expertly choreographed but instantly forgettable. Then we meet \"Galinda\" (Ariana Grande) who arrives in her pink bubble to confirm the news and enjoy the celebrations. Turns out, though, that she and the erstwhile \"Wicked Witch of the West\" were once friends and so back in time we go to the birth of a little green baby who may (or may not) have been conceived within the bounds of happily married wedlock. Scoot on many years more and we discover that said green person - \"Elphaba\" (Cynthia Erivo) is accompanying her wheelchair bound sister \"Nessarose\" (Marissa Bode) to the \"Ozian\" equivalent of \"Hogwarts\" where she encounters the snobbish \"Galinda\" and a fairly comprehensive degree of hostility. Luckily for her, the legendary sorceress \"Madame Morrible\" (Michelle Yeoh) spots some hidden talent in this young woman and soon she is sharing rooms with her new nemesis and finding herself the butt of school jokes. Then enter the mischievous prince \"Fiyero\" (Jonathan Bailey) who tends to treat everyone the same and who\\'s been kicked out of more schools that he can shake a sceptre at. He does, however, manage to create an environment in which everyone can get along and that\\'s when things begin to change for an \"Elphaba\" who is to be made likeable by her now pally roomie. When a letter arrives from the all-powerful Wizard (Jeff Goldblum) summoning her to the \"Emerald City\", then they set off hoping to find answers to all of their questions, only to find that nothing there is as it seems... I have to admit that JB has been a friend of mine for many years, so I ain\\'t going to be saying anything bad about the man who might just be the next \"007\", and both Erivo and Grande do well enough with the set piece musical numbers - especially the lively and cleverly written \"Populer/lar\", but the rest of this just struck me as \"Harry Potter\" goes to the musicals where it meets \"Mean Girls\". Goldblum makes his presence felt, but in the same slightly affected fashion that he aways does, and though the visual effects are all fantastic, somehow they are all just so much more sterile to watch than when you see them within the confines of a theatrical stage - where this works so much better, and without the need for the commercially exploitative part 1 and part 2 released months apart. To be fair, everyone looks like they are enjoying themselves, there\\'s a fun number from Idina Menzel and Kristin Chenoweth and Bailey brings some much needed charm to the proceedings but I\\'d probably just prefer a director\\'s cut that offered us the whole story in one three hour chunk so we can get that mediocre \"Defying Gravity\" power ballad out of the way (repeatedly) in one fell swoop. It\\'s a very polished production, and maybe the hype has just got to me, but I can\\'t pretend I wasn\\'t disappointed by this. Wilted more than wicked, sorry.',\n",
       "  'It’s quite a rare occurrence these days when a much-anticipated film actually lives up to all of its pre-release hype, but this screen adaptation of the hit Broadway musical truly does so in every regard. Director Jon M. Chu has brilliantly brought to life the back story behind the lives and relationship of the two witches from the original L. Frank Baum novel The Wonderful Wizard of Oz (1900) and its 1939 classic screen adaptation, as well as Gregory Maguire’s 1995 prequel novel, Wicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West. In this stunningly beautiful and delightful big-screen production, viewers learn how the supposedly evil Elphaba (Cynthia Erivo) came to know the purportedly Glinda the Good (Ariana Grande-Butera), sorcery students and college roommates whose relationship initially went through a series of changes from unabashed contempt to solid friendship. However, as high-level political intrigue unfolds in their homeland of the magical land of Oz – efforts clandestinely spearheaded by the supposedly all-powerful Wizard (Jeff Goldblum) and university headmistress Mme. Morrible (Michelle Yeoh) – Elphaba and Glinda become unwittingly caught up in the high-stakes subterfuge playing out around them, a development that jeopardizes the future of their friendship and the stability of Oz itself. The filmmaker thus subtly but effectively presents audiences with a fable on the nature of good and evil, particularly in terms of what actually constitutes wickedness, especially when it’s skillfully veiled. The result is a thoughtful and thoroughly entertaining tale replete with stunning musical numbers, excellent choreography, ample humor, gorgeous cinematography, an inspired production design and superb performances by the four principals, all of whom are certain to be strong awards season candidates (quite a recommendation coming from someone who unapologetically makes no claim to being a fan of musicals). More than that, though, “Wicked” is an insightful treatise on the quest for power and learning how to make judicious use of it, both in personal dealings and in matters of wider consequence, a fitting cautionary tale for our times (or any time, for that matter). If I had any complaint here, it would be my concern that this is yet another example of a story that’s been divided up into two installments, a growing trend that I don’t believe will ultimately serve the movie industry well. According to the director, this was seen as a necessary step to do justice to the source material, given that it would have been nearly impossible to cram everything into one picture without doing major damage to the content. And, to give the filmmaker the benefit of the doubt, perhaps that will ultimately prove true with the release of part 2 in 2025 (but I’ll reserve judgment on that for the time being). In the meantime, though, this first part comes through as promised, and, in this day and age, that’s a cinematic miracle in itself.',\n",
       "  \"Very good! I enjoyed <em>'Wicked'</em>.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlways impressive when a long run time flashes by - no doubt a sign of a sturdy movie. 2hr 40mins is how long this one lasts, I thought I might have felt that whilst watching but, honestly, I didn't. Since sharing my reviews online I have appreciated musicals much more, to the point that when I learn a film is from this genre it barely registers.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have never seen the stage musical, in fact the only detail I knew for certain was that it was from the world of <em>'The Wizard of Oz'</em> - which, in turn, I only know from the 1939 and 2013 movies, as well as one or two other flicks. As such, I wasn't actually sure where they were heading with the Wicked Witch of the West - but I approve.\\r\\n\\r\\nCynthia Erivo impresses as the aforementioned. I have to say, mind, that Ariana Grande is the person onscreen that stood out most. She does an excellent job at making her character's self-centered quirks so convincing, while also producing a few amusing moments too. Jonathan Bailey and Peter Dinklage are good, while Jeff Goldblum certainly fits his role.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ending, whilst perfectly fine and pleasing, is possibly a bit rushed/abrupt, though that's to be expected given it's only part one. The same can be said for most films that are split into multiple productions, to be fair. I am intrigued to see where part two goes, bring on this time next year.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe music is, as one would expect, also a positive. Granted I don't think I'll be adding any of the tracks to my playlist, but I still had a pleasant time hearing all the songs come and go - not one sticks out like a sore thumb, so that's good. Elsewhere, visually and plot-wise I have no real complaints.\",\n",

With the right ingredients, even the oddest of ideas can take flight on stage… but in the delicate translation to screen, they crash-land. Take Cats: something about that core premise of humans playing felines – which theatre audiences lapped up (sorry) for decades – just didn’t work at the movies.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom the outside, it’s easy to paint Wicked with the same brush.

But peel back the colours of any GOOD fantasy and you’ll usually find the allegories are rich and meaningful. With its themes of parental guilt, absent fatherhood, disability, discrimination and class supremacy, Wicked is no exception.\\r\\n\\r\\nLook, we’re not saying Wicked’s perfect. At 2 hours 40 minutes, it’s knocking HARD on the “too long, wrap it up!” door. And there’s characters that either overdo it a bit (Governor Thropp) or arguably, don’t add much at all (oh Pfannee, do you even go to this school?).\\r\\n\\r\\nBut that’s a bit like complaining about a scratch on a speedboat. A sleek, wondrous craft that can whiz you somewhere thrilling, and change you along the way. We didn’t have crazy high expectations – hey, the everyday moviegoer isn’t a hardcore Broadway fan – but honestly? You don’t need to be. Wicked is a movie for anyone. And maybe that’s why it feels so GOOD.',\n",

       "  \"I so wanted to hate it.\\r\\n\\r\\nI didn't like the decision to split the musical into two films. I didn't like the casting. I HATED the trailer, where it made the film look like it was baked with plastic, glossy CGI, or even worse Gen-AI.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd I was wrong.\\r\\n\\r\\nErivo and Grande are stellar. The co-stars aren't who I'd have picked, but they're quite excellent themselves. (Particularly the folks playing Bok and Nessa.) \\r\\n\\r\\nIt's a glorious, beautiful, and joyful film in many ways. When Elphaba finally soars, my heart soared as well and I found myself tearing up. \\r\\n\\r\\nI also appreciated how it gives a nod to the much, much darker book, especially with the propaganda posters and effigy in the opening, and the various references to Oz's takeover. (Like when the stone edifice falls off the side of the school building revealing the animals beneath.)\\r\\n\\r\\nMy only complaint is, as with any two or three-parter, lots of the filler is garbage. This is especially true  of the Dancing Through Life number, which becomes unbearably long and significantly less magical because of the added content. \\r\\n\\r\\nStill, highly recommended. 8/10 Stars.\",\n",
       "  'Wicked by Jon M. Chu is an ambitious adaptation that largely delivers on its promise to bring the magic of the beloved musical to the big screen. Visually, the movie is stunning, with vibrant set pieces and a cinematic take on Oz that feels both familiar and fresh. Cynthia Erivo as Elphaba brings an emotional depth that truly captures the character’s struggles, while Ariana Grande’s Glinda adds a balance of charm and humor. Together, their performances anchor the film and make the story’s core themes, friendship, identity, and societal perception, shine.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe musical numbers are undeniably the movie’s highlight. Songs like \"Defying Gravity\" are powerful and beautifully staged, though I couldn’t help but feel the choreography, while good, could have been taken a step further to truly elevate the experience. The pacing is a mixed bag, with the first act taking its time to set the stage, which may feel slow for some. That said, once the story finds its rhythm, it balances the emotional beats with grandeur fairly well, though the shifts in tone could have been smoothed out more.\\r\\n\\r\\nOverall, Wicked succeeds as a visually impressive and emotionally resonant adaptation, even if it stumbles in a few places. It’s a solid film for fans of the musical and newcomers alike. While there’s room for improvement, particularly in pacing and choreography, it’s hard to deny that the performances and visual storytelling make it a worthwhile watch.'],\n",

       " ['I\\'d completely forgotten about \"Bad Boys for Life\" (2020) but luckily there are were few flashbacks to remind me that \"Mike\" (Will Smith) had been the target of a son he didn\\'t know about - \"Armando\" (Jacob Scipio) - and that both he and partner \"Marcus\" (Martin Lawrence) risked life and limb to get him behind bars. Well now, a few years later, \"Mike\" has just got married; \"Marcus\" has had a revelatory out-of-body experience and their beloved \"Capt. Howard\" (Joe Pantoliano) has been killed. The authorities become increasingly convinced that he was on the take from the drugs cartels. $20m in your bank account can arouse some suspicions - though the Porsche and beautiful waterside home of \"Mike\" might have too! Anyway, our duo are having none of these scurrilous allegations and decide to investigate. \"Howard\" expected some sort of disaster, so has left the pair some breadcrumbs that lead them to suspect that there is someone close to them who is corrupt. With the body count piling up, they turn to the incarcerated \"Armando\" who thinks he may be able to identify the ringleader. That just makes him a target too - so pretty soon it\\'s a nimble, deadly and quite grumpy triumvirate who are on the trail of the murderers. From now on we have a standard and predicable action adventure with loads of lively pyrotechnics, car stunts and an hungry albino crocodile to accompany some quite witty repartee between the two men who are clearly very much at ease in each other\\'s company. There\\'s a bit of eye candy from Alexander Ludwig and the underused Vanessa Hudgens and the pace of the drama builds to a denouement that works well enough whilst screaming sequel at us loudly. It\\'s nothing at all new, but is an engaging exercise in on-screen charisma and I did quite enjoy it.',\n",
       "  \"For a fourth outing, <em>'Bad Boys: Ride or Die'</em> still finds a way to produce the goods.\\r\\n\\r\\nI enjoyed what I watched. The previous installment remains the clear standout of the series comparatively speaking, though I was pleased to see this one still deliver the nessacary entertainment; it's perhaps my second favourite from the franchise. It does have flaws of course, like I'd say it's more serious than humourous and the more sincere stuff doesn't always hit as intended; especially the bits about Howard.\\r\\n\\r\\nStill, there's enough positive humour in there. Will Smith and Martin Lawrence continue to please in the lead roles, they are a great match. The rest of the cast are all decent enough, Ioan Gruffudd plays what feels like a typical Ioan Gruffudd character well. Jacob Scipio, meanwhile, is pretty solid.\\r\\n\\r\\nI will say, though, that Rhea Seehorn is underused - she's way too good for these sorta bit part roles! There are also cameo-esque appearances from Tiffany Haddish and DJ Khaled, which sounds bad on paper but, actually, both of their scenes are actually quite amusing! Away from those onscreen, camera work and editing are both pluses.\\r\\n\\r\\nDo we need a fifth <em>'Bad Boys'</em> film? No. Would I watch a fifth <em>'Bad Boys'</em> film? Yes. Yes I would.\",\n",
       "  'I didn’t know what to expect going into the fourth installment of one of my favorite buddy cop franchises. Having seen the first movie in theaters at age 13, I grew up with this series and had my doubts about its ability to evolve. Fortunately, I was pleasantly surprised.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis film was a joy to watch, even though it was missing Theresa Randle, whose absence was felt. Despite this, the filmmakers managed to capture the heart and spirit that fans have come to love. The narrative remains engaging, and seeing these characters return was a real treat.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe film experimented a lot with camera techniques and visual effects. While some of these choices didn’t resonate with me, they reflect a bold attempt to refresh the series. For instance, there are several action sequences that use innovative camera angles and CGI that might feel overdone, but they also add a new layer of excitement. This experimentation is evident in a particularly intense chase scene where the dynamic camera work heightens the tension, even if it occasionally feels a bit disorienting. Definitely A LOT of Neon.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne concern I had from the trailer was the Reba McEntire joke, which seemed lame out of context. However, within the film, it actually pays off in a funny and unexpected way. This moment exemplifies how the film often exceeds expectations, taking seemingly minor elements and turning them into memorable highlights.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe heart of the film and its story align well with what fans love about the franchise. The camaraderie and banter between the leads are as sharp as ever, providing both laughs and heartfelt moments. For example, a scene where the partners reminisce about their first case together brings a touch of nostalgia while reinforcing their enduring bond.\\r\\n\\r\\nOverall, this fourth installment is a pretty good sequel that honors the legacy of its predecessors while introducing fresh elements. Despite some reservations about the new visual styles, the film’s core strengths—its characters and story—remain intact. If you are a fan of the genre and especially this franchise, you’ll likely find much to enjoy here. The film strikes a balance between innovation and familiarity, ensuring that both longtime fans and new viewers can appreciate its charms.',\n",

       "  'I had an absolute blast watching “Bad Boys: Ride or Die,” the fourth installment in the popular buddy comedy / action franchise that started off with a bang way back in 1995. Co-directors Adil El Arbi and Bilall Fallah, back at the helm after 2020’s “Bad Boys for Life,” pay homage to the “Bad Boys” legacy while injecting new life into it. As a longtime fan, this film actually over delivers. It is everything I wanted and more. I feel like the word-of-mouth on this movie is going to be electric and if audiences decide to show up, it very well could be the movie that saves the summer box office.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen their former Captain and friend Conrad Howard (Joe Pantoliano) is implicated in a corruption scandal involving a dangerous cartel, Miami police officers Marcus (Martin Lawrence) and Mike (Will Smith) have to work to clear his name. After a series of unexpected events, the partners find themselves on the other end of the law. Now on the run as wanted criminals (and on a hit list of local gangs), Mike and Marcus must stay ahead of the cops and the cartel while rushing to solve the mystery of who wants to frame the late Captain Howard. With danger closing in and not knowing who to trust, the men must rely on their wits, their friendship, and their street-smart instincts to survive.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is a lot that works well here, starting with a strong story where the stakes are high, the danger feels real, and the villain is formidable. The plot, which isn’t loaded with silly twists and turns, is actually plausible. It’s a rare combination in what could’ve been just another mindless summer blockbuster, and there’s a lot more meat on the bones, narrative-wise. The film also rekindles a love for what I now consider modern iconic characters. Marcus and Mike may be older, but their banter, camaraderie, and comedic timing all still feel relevant. Most of this is due to Smith and Lawrence being a terrific pair, bickering with a natural chemistry that comes across as effortless. You believe these two guys would give their lives for each other, which makes the story even stronger. It is such a pleasure to see these two back together again.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe R-rated action is among the best of the franchise, too, from high-speed chases to intense, bloody shootouts. There are a series of inventive scenes that are expertly choreographed and storyboarded, and it’s been a while since I’ve seen such fresh and original action sequences like the ones here. The creativity sets (and hits) a higher bar, and El Arbi and Fallah’s contemporary directorial approach is stylish, energetic, and results in adrenaline-fueled action scenes that are so well done that the film is a literal heart pounder. This is one of those stand up and cheer type of films that’s best experienced with an audience that’s also fired up to be there.\\r\\n\\r\\nI absolutely loved everything about “Bad Boys: Ride or Die.” It’s the type of action film that’s done so well, you’ll leave the theater feeling that overwhelming sense of exhilaration that can only be described as a Hollywood high. If you love the genre, make it a priority to go see this one.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy: Louisa Moore / SCREEN ZEALOTS',\n",

       " ['It’s more than a little frustrating when a film seemingly has all of the elements needed to make it work except the one that’s most crucial, the one that enables a production to brilliantly succeed or doom it to failure – the story. Such is the case with director Edward Berger’s latest, the much-anticipated, much-celebrated drama about the convening of a papal conclave to select a new pope. From a technical standpoint, the filmmaker has pulled together everything that should make this an epic picture – a gorgeous production design, stunning and inventive cinematography, and a stellar cast featuring superb performances by the likes of Ralph Fiennes, Stanley Tucci, John Lithgow and Isabella Rossellini, as well as fine turns by such lesser-known performers (at least to American audiences) as Lucian Msamati and Sergio Castellito. The picture also raises some insightful observations (though a little too infrequently for my tastes) about the current state of the Roman Catholic Church, particularly its foot-dragging on implementing reforms, the incessant high-profile scandals that have rocked the institution, and the rising tide of unflattering public perceptions among its increasingly skeptical practitioners, all of which weigh heavily on the College of Cardinals in determining who should be named as the new Holy Father. Unfortunately, though, the story and script leave a lot to be desired. For starters, much of the film’s opening act moves by at a glacial pace, frequently causing one’s eyelids to become more than a little heavy. As the picture moves into the meat of the story – the conclave itself – it waxes somewhat melodramatic, not unlike a glorified 1980s prime time TV soap opera. Its attempt to come across as an intrigue-laced thriller amounts to more than a succession of backstabbing segments in which the leading candidates to become the next pontiff are systematically eliminated through the revelation of skeletons in their respective closets. Finally, as the movie enters the stretch run, it throws in several twists and turns that either come completely out of left field (and somewhat implausibly at that) or that predictably materialize on cue thanks to the planting of patently obvious clues early on that were wholly impossible to ignore as the story plays out. Regrettably, these narrative foibles undermine all of the other fine attributes that this production has going for it, ultimately amounting to a case of being long on style but a little skimpy on substance, a shortcoming that also plagued Berger’s last feature outing, “All Quiet on the Western Front” (2022). Unlike many others who have been so profoundly moved and thoroughly captivated by this release, perhaps my not having been born and raised Roman Catholic has somehow prevented me from fully appreciating the depth and magnitude accorded to this offering’s contents. But, as someone who seeks to evaluate everything I screen on an equal footing, I can’t help but observe that “Conclave” simply doesn’t measure up when it comes to what it takes to make a genuine big screen epic.',\n",

       "  \"<em>'Conclave'</em> has a lot to enjoy about it, even if it is slightly overlong.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe performances are its biggest strength, which is an element that is critical to get correct for talky films like this - and thankfully this one does get it right.

John Lithgow, Stanley Tucci, Lucian Msamati and Sergio Castellitto merit praise too.\\r\\n\\r\\nI love the score, while the cinematography is splendid. The story is very watchable, even for someone like me who has zero interest in religion. I will say that the film does last a bit longer than it needs to, I wasn't ever bored or anything close but across the final chunk I was awaiting the end credits. It feels like a two-hour movie - not negatively, just noticeably.\",\n",
       "  'When the Pope dies, it falls to the Dean of the College of Cardinals, \"Cardinal Lawrence\" (Ralph Fiennes) to organise the conclave that will elect his successor. His own personal preference is for the liberal \"Bellini\" (Stanley Tucci) but there is also plenty of support elsewhere. \"Adeyami\" (Lucian Msamati) could be the first pontiff from Africa; \"Tremblay\" (John Lithgow) is an ambitious American and \"Tedesco\" (Sergio Castellitto) the formidable and ultra-conservative candidate. As they are all assembling, a surprise arrives in the form of the hitherto unknown Cardinal Archbishop of Kabul (Carlos Diehz) and so now, the red tables are set for a process that shines a light on the flawed humanity of many of the men gathered together. For all of their ostensibly benign spirituality, these are politicians and even \"Lawrence\" finds his faith, his patience and his loyalties tested as he becomes aware of a conspiracy. Or is it a series of conspiracies? Is he being manipulated? Is it all just a smokescreen? With the voting showing little sign of breaking a deadlock amongst the 108 men sequestered in the room, he begins to fear that the outside world might conclude that the church is divided. That very same outside world, meantime, is suffering from a spate of terrorist attacks that even the ancient walls of the Vatican cannot shield them from, as the old traditions battle for supremacy with the more modern ones. Not since the \"English Patient\" (1996) have I seen Fiennes deliver like this. His character is a conflicted one, and he portrays that effectively - especially as he wrestles with his own crises of conscience and faith. Those deliberations lead him to a very difficult choice at a denouement that I didn\\'t really love. It came a lot from left field and though quite thought-provoking to an extent, seemed just a bit too contrived to make a point that I felt rather stretched plausibility in what was hitherto quite a compelling thriller. Isabella Rossellini barely features and I thought added little to the drama beyond being a conduit for other, rather undercooked, aspects of the plot to develop. It\\'s a good, solid, thriller that illustrates that politicians in cassocks and red hats are no less ruthless when they play for power, and it is a good watch. Maybe just not a great one.',\n",
       "  \"Conclave is a film for those willing to immerse themselves fully. It's a slow-burning, almost hypnotic narrative where every word, every pause holds weight. There's no attempt to shock or force drama here. This is a measured, deeply atmospheric experience.\\r\\n\\r\\nRalph Fiennes delivers one of the finest performances of his career. His character is like a wall with cracks—you peer into them and sense the storm brewing behind. His restraint is captivating, and when he finally raises his voice, it feels like the rupture of silence itself, as if his inner chaos can no longer be contained. These moments tear through the screen.\\r\\n\\r\\nBerger crafts an utterly unique atmosphere. The Sistine Chapel, the endless papal corridors, shadowy corners, and striking red-and-black tones transform into active participants in the story. This isn’t just a backdrop—it’s the film’s lifeblood.\\r\\n\\r\\nStefan Fontaine’s cinematography breathes life into these walls, slicing through spaces with long takes and obsessive symmetry. Each frame feels like a gallery piece—it’s a joy to watch.\\r\\n\\r\\nVolker Bertelmann's score beats like the film’s heart, tightening the tension to its limits. His thunderous, almost liturgical chords make each vote feel monumental and decisive.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe most fascinating part: the story unfolds gradually. While the initial monotony of dialogue may seem tedious, the deeper you dive, the more palpable the tension becomes. The intrigue builds, and the details—from the architecture to the character dynamics—form a compelling tapestry of a near-detective political thriller.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the ending… It leaves you questioning whether the journey was worth it. On one hand, the open-ended conclusion provokes reflection. On the other, it might leave some viewers puzzled or even underwhelmed.\\r\\n\\r\\nYet, Conclave is undeniably a film for connoisseurs: profound, meditative, and aesthetically impeccable. It’s not just about Vatican intrigue; it’s a deeply symbolic story of power, faith, and doubt. Berger’s mastery of space, Fiennes’ magnetic presence, and the soul-piercing score come together to create one of the year’s most stylish and powerful films. \\r\\n\\r\\n4.5\\\\5, Thank you for taking the time to read a humble opinion from a lover of good cinema.\",\n",

Samara Weaving absolutely owns her role with such expressive intensity and raw energy that you can’t take your eyes off her.

Her performance is electric, and she brings so much life to a movie that often feels like it’s just... happening around her.\\r\\n\\r\\nVisually, the film is stunning. The cinematography and the dark, oppressive atmosphere set the perfect tone for a post-apocalyptic horror. The Burned Ones are terrifying to look at, and the world feels genuinely dangerous. But where it falters is the script. There’s no backstory, no real character buildup, and the lack of explanation for anything, be it the monsters, the cult, or Azrael’s choices, leaves you feeling like you’re grasping at straws to make sense of it all. A little more depth or context would’ve gone a long way in turning this into something truly memorable.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs it stands, Azrael is a chilling, beautifully directed horror movie with flashes of brilliance, but it’s ultimately a missed opportunity.

       " ['I suppose that many of us have had the god-squad on the doorstep trying to peddle their philosophising but I doubt many are quite as prepared, or as tempting, as the butter-wouldn\\'t-melt \"Reed\" (Hugh Grant) when the enthusiastic sisters \"Barnes\" (Sophie Thatcher) and \"Paxton\" (Chloe East) arrive at his door. Promises of a meeting with his wife and some blueberry pie lure them in and soon they are having a meaningful debate that rather puts the girls on edge. That anxiety only gets worse as there\\'s no sign of the wife and the scented candle proves to have a most unusual, and illuminating, aroma. They conclude that getting out of his home is the best plan, but that isn\\'t going to be straightforward. He has other plans, and they are going to have to play a game of belief/disbelief if they are to have any hope of getting back to their church. The horror aspects of this are not especially interesting - it\\'s a sort of competent hybrid of \"Escape Room\" meets \"Cluedo\". What helps this stand out a bit more is a subtly menacing effort from Grant and the standard of the writing. The conversation between the three for the first half of the film is quite thought provoking in itself. It asks questions that are truly valid and worthy of consideration amongst those of or without organised faith. The assertions around \"iterations\", burgers and games of \"Monopoly\" also raise a few solid questions about carts and horses that I rather appreciated as we are invited to question or evaluate the whole scope of monotheistic religions and their role in our lives. The two women gel well together here too, realising that they are in some sort of peril - both intellectual and physical, and that latter threat is well demonstrated by some creepy settings and creatively used audio. I didn\\'t love the conclusion - I actually found it really quite disappointing, as if Scott Beck had just run out of ideas or didn\\'t quite have the courage of his earlier convictions, but this is the most substantial part I\\'ve seen Grant play in a while and he holds it together well. Not your typical psychological drama and worth a watch, I\\'d say.',\n",

       "  'In the new film “Heretic”, two missionaries named Sister Barnes (Sophie Thatcher) and Sister Paxton (Chloe East) spend their days in fellowship and looking to bring new members into their faith. Sister Paxton is the more sheltered of the two as Sister Barnes comes from the East Coast and joined the church through conversion and appears much wiser in the ways of the world to her colleague.\\r\\n\\r\\nEager to get her first new member for Sister Paxton; the two venture to visit Mr. Reed (Hugh Grant), who had earlier expressed interest in their church and as such; made his way onto the contact list for the girls.\\r\\n\\r\\nA storm arrives at the same time the girls do but unable to enter the home of Mr. Reed without a female being present; they are assured that his wife is baking in the kitchen and accept his offer to come in out of the weather.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey find Mr. Reed charming and very well-versed in theology as he says that he has been studying religions for over a decade and his knowledge is very impressive to the girls yet his questions, answers, and tone start to become disturbing to the girls as does the absence of his wife whom he claims is just in the other room.\\r\\n\\r\\nLooking for a chance to leave, the girls discover that they are locked in and the house has a metal overlay that blocks their cell signals. Further complicating matters is the increasingly odd behavior of Mr. Reed who insists that they are free to leave at any time yet confronts them with all manner of theological questions, theories, and challenges at every turn.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat follows is a chilling exercise in faith for the girls in a gripping film that keeps you guessing all along.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe cast is solid and Grant is very good playing against type.

       "  'No matter what anyone might say, putting lipstick on a pig doesn’t change the fact that one is still dealing with a pig. And that’s very much the case with this dismally failed attempt at smart horror from writer-directors Scott Beck and Bryan Woods. When two naïve Mormon missionaries (Sophie Thatcher, Chloe East) visit the remote home of a creepy, loquacious middle-aged loner (Hugh Grant) in an attempt to convert him, the trio launches into a protracted conversation about the nature of “the one true religion.” To a certain extent, it’s an intriguing philosophical discussion – at least for a while – until it gradually descends into a series of longwinded fits and starts characterized by disjointed, unrelated, unresolved segments that try viewer patience. The dialogue increasingly amounts to a series of overwrought contrivances undermined by implausible character development, particularly among the two supposed innocents who begin spouting lines that are difficult to accept in light of their supposedly gullible, unsophisticated nature and narrow worldview. But then, in a desperate attempt to retain fading audience attention, the picture degenerates into little more than a meandering slasher movie, albeit with better production design than one typically finds in such fare. What’s more, this offering’s exasperating script heavily “borrows” from an endless stream of religious, philosophical and cinematic sources, one even suggesting that this could turn into the second coming of “The Butterfly Effect” and “Matrix” franchises. And, while Grant and his co-stars genuinely deliver more than capable portrayals of the three principals, even their performances aren’t enough to cover the inherent weaknesses of this material, no matter how much lipstick is applied to it. Considering the foregoing, I’m truly mystified by the much-celebrated response this offering has been accorded given its tiresome narrative and pretentious, largely pointless overall direction, an experiment that just doesn’t work. As a fan of the smart horror genre and its aim of elevating the content of more classic releases in this area of cinema, I’m seriously disappointed that the inspired creators of “A Quiet Place” (2018) haven’t come up with something better here, an outcome that’s definitely heretical in itself.',\n",
       "  'Written and directed by Scott Beck and Bryan Woods (65, Haunt, writers of A Quiet Place), Heretic is a so-called psychological horror that is disappointing on all fronts. After only seeing the trailer once months ago, I initially thought that Heretic was a film about a serial killer (Hugh Grant) who used his crazy mouse trap-contraption house to lure in religious, door-to-door service people and kill them.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile that is partially the case, Heretic follows two missionaries from The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints; Sister Barnes (Sophie Thatcher, The Book of Boba Fett) and Sister Paxton (Chloe East, The Wolf of Snow Hollow). The two women go to the house of Mr. Reed (Grant) who has expressed interest in hearing more about their religion.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs Sister Barnes and Sister Paxton make their way inside, they soon find themselves trapped in Mr. Reed’s bizarrely intricate home featuring electricity on a timer, a front door that supposedly won’t open again until morning, and that the house being made of metal blocks cell phone signals. \\r\\n\\r\\nReed, a theology major with vast knowledge of all religions, claims to have found the one true religion. Whether the two women will escape or if Reed knows what he’s talking about is factors into the cerebral aspect of the film.\\r\\n\\r\\nMartin Freeman constantly looked miserable and bored out of his mind when he appeared in films like The Hobbit trilogy or the Sherlock TV series. He suddenly looked like he was having the time of his life when he shifted film genres, plunged into horror, and starred in the 2017 film Ghost Stories.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt seems to be the same case for Hugh Grant. While this isn’t his first horror film, Heretic is his first film in the genre in 36 years (Grant starred in The Lair of the White Room in 1988). Grant is noticeably lively in his performance in Heretic though and seems downright giddy to be torturing people.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith cinematography by Chung Chung-hoon (Last Night in Soho, The Handmaiden), Heretic has two visually memorable sequences thanks to how they’re shot. When Sister Barnes and Sister Paxton first arrive, Mr. Reed leaves the room to check on his “wife.” While he’s gone, Barnes turns the candle he blew out and discovers what the scent of the candle is. As she slowly turns the candle, the camera turns with it.\\r\\n\\r\\nReed has a miniature duplicate of his house complete with little figures that represent Sister Barnes and Sister Paxton. In a sequence when Sister Paxton is trying to run away from Mr. Reed, we’re following her movements in the miniature but it seamlessly transitions from the model to the real thing when she enters the room and slams the door.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe method in which Heretic is written is somewhat odd. Not quite horrific enough to be scary with its religion-defying dialogue taking center stage, Heretic is essentially a two-hour sermon attempting to destroy your faith with some splashes of blood and a raggedy woman or two dying in a blueberry pie.  \\r\\n\\r\\nIt feels like if you walked into Heretic devoted to the Mormon religion, you’ll walk out of the theater a different person. Mr. Reed’s arguments regarding all religions stemming from the same concept are portrayed in a way that is believable and convincing.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe somehow rambles about Monopoly and board games, music, and vinyl records to demonstrate similarities between certain board games, how some songs are essentially the same tunes with different lyrics, and that all religions are more similar than dissimilar.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile the dialogue-driven film can be interesting, it’s also fairly boring. There’s an unsettling aspect to Mr. Reed’s behavior that capitalizes on the tension in the film. But there are also these long stretches where nothing happens besides the next topic of conversation or a weak payoff where someone’s throat is cut with a box cutter or something.\\r\\n\\r\\nHeretic is beautifully shot with a stellar performance from Hugh Grant, but its intriguing concept is drowned out by the desire to deconvert the audience and have a lukewarm reveal regarding whatever the one-true religion is. Watching the film is like being trapped in a church of a religion you don’t believe in with an overwhelmingly passionate pastor trying to dissuade you from ever coming back.'],\n",

Well they do manage to make contact with a nearby diver whose bell was stranded on the sea bed, and he tells them some stuff about the poles being reversed and the water all skedaddling to the far side of the Earth. Maybe go join up with him? Well before that can happen they encounter another survivor, but he\\'s a nasty piece of work and soon the family are reduced in number and having to make their way on foot to find their radio contact before they are crab food. Yep, it\\'s terrible. It\\'s not that it\\'s just entirely implausible from start to finish, it\\'s that the acting is as bad as I\\'ve seen in ages and the fact that it is in French ought not to put you off unduly because there is precisely nothing at all in the dialogue that enhances either the film in general or any sense of peril that\\'s distinctly absent throughout the entire ninety minutes. What was most worrying was that it ends as if there might be a sequel.

Thanos has appeared in several other MCU films, but he seemed rather flat in those movies. Here, he's allowed to be fully developed as a character.

       "  '**How \"Terrifier 3\" Redefines Horror Cinema and Mirrors Societal Anxieties**\\r\\n\\r\\n**Introduction**\\r\\nIn a cinematic landscape often dominated by high-budget blockbusters and familiar franchises, \"Terrifier 3\" emerges as a remarkable exception. Directed by Damien Leone, this low-budget horror film has defied industry expectations by grossing over $82 million worldwide against a modest $2 million budget. Beyond its financial success, the film offers a profound exploration of psychological fears, societal tensions, and subtle political commentary, redefining the potential of horror cinema in the 21st century.\\r\\n\\r\\n**A Subversion of Holiday Traditions**\\r\\nSet against the ironically cheerful backdrop of Christmas Eve, \"Terrifier 3\" subverts traditional holiday themes by delving into the darkest corners of human fear. The malevolent antagonist, Art the Clown - portrayed with chilling intensity by David Howard Thornton - embodies unpredictability and chaos. His reign of terror over Miles County isn\\'t just a series of gruesome events; it\\'s a relentless assault on the notions of safety, normalcy, and the comfort typically associated with the holiday season.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Psychological Exploration**\\r\\nAt its core, the film is a psychological study of fear and human responses to extreme situations. It taps into Carl Jung\\'s concept of the \"shadow self,\" compelling both characters and viewers to confront the darker aspects of their psyche. Art the Clown is not merely a villain; he represents repressed anxieties and the chaotic potential within society. The notably subdued reactions of audiences - such as the silent screening experiences I experienced in CinemaCity in Romania - highlight the film\\'s ability to reach deep into the subconscious, evoking a primal response that transcends typical cinematic experiences.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Social Commentary and Contemporary Relevance**\\r\\n\"Terrifier 3\" serves as a mirror reflecting contemporary societal fears. In an era marked by global uncertainties and the erosion of traditional safety nets, the film\\'s disruption of the holiday idyll resonates powerfully. It challenges the illusion of security in familiar settings, suggesting that chaos can intrude upon life without warning. This theme is particularly poignant given current global anxieties related to political polarization, social unrest, and the fragility of societal structures.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Subtle Political Undertones**\\r\\nThe movie subtly weaves in commentary on the divisiveness and unpredictability that have characterized recent political landscapes, particularly echoing sentiments reminiscent of calls to \"make it great again.\" Even it might be a bit of a stretch interpretation it lands very well and align in reality we are today. Art the Clown\\'s embodiment of chaos and his assault on societal norms can be interpreted as an allegory for the breakdown of traditional structures and the rise of polarizing forces. His relentless terror reflects the disruption of established conventions, forcing communities to grapple with unprecedented challenges - a parallel to the societal upheavals experienced during turbulent political times.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe narrative also examines leadership and authority. The inability of societal institutions within the film to contain or comprehend the terror inflicted by Art the Clown mirrors real-world frustrations with ineffective governance in the face of crises. This reflection invites contemplation on how societies become vulnerable when trust in leadership erodes.\\r\\n\\r\\n_Note: The interpretations presented regarding the political undertones, are my personal opinions and reflections. Don\\'t get to excited! :)_\\r\\n\\r\\n**David Howard Thornton\\'s Masterful Performance**\\r\\nThornton\\'s portrayal of Art the Clown elevates the character from a mere slasher antagonist to a symbol of deeper psychological, social, and political fears. His ability to convey menace without dialogue relies on physicality and expressive nuance, creating a sinister charisma that is both repulsive and captivating. This performance is instrumental in making the film\\'s thematic explorations resonate so profoundly with audiences.\\r\\n\\r\\n**The Appeal of Extreme Horror**\\r\\nThe film\\'s financial success, despite - or perhaps because of - its extreme gore and brutality, speaks to a cultural fascination with boundary-pushing content. \"Terrifier 3\" taps into the audience\\'s desire for cathartic experiences, offering a space to explore intense emotions and confront the darker facets of humanity. This attraction to extreme horror can be seen as a form of collective processing of fear and uncertainty, providing both an escape from and a reflection of real-world tensions.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Implications for the Film Industry**\\r\\n\"Terrifier 3\" challenges conventional wisdom in the film industry regarding the profitability and impact of low-budget productions. Its success demonstrates that audiences are hungry for content that is innovative, thought-provoking, and willing to push boundaries. The film exemplifies how strategic storytelling and thematic depth can overcome financial limitations, suggesting a shift in how success can be achieved in cinema.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor filmmakers and industry professionals, \"Terrifier 3\" serves as a case study in leveraging genre conventions to explore complex themes while engaging audiences on multiple levels. It highlights the potential for horror films to transcend entertainment, becoming vehicles for social commentary and philosophical inquiry.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Conclusion**\\r\\n\"Terrifier 3\" is more than a horror film; it\\'s a bold artistic statement that challenges viewers psychologically, socially, and potentially politically . Damien Leone has crafted a work that is unflinching in its depiction of terror yet rich with depth and relevance. The movie invites audiences not only to experience fear but to question its origins and implications within the context of contemporary society.\\r\\nAs the film continues to captivate and unsettle viewers worldwide, it redefines the potential of horror cinema in the 21st century. \"Terrifier 3\" stands as a testament to the power of storytelling that is unafraid to delve into the complexities of existence, reflecting and challenging the societal and political currents of our times.\\r\\n\\r\\n**\"Terrifier 4\" is just inevitable!**',\n",

What begins as an intriguing narrative with potential to explore Art the Clown’s backstory quickly dissolves into a series of chaotic, disconnected scenes that seem to exist solely to justify the excess of gore.\\r\\n\\r\\nCharacter development is practically non-existent, and any attempt to offer a narrative arc is abandoned in favor of an endless parade of graphic violence. While the special effects are impressive and true to the visceral spirit of the saga, it feels like an empty spectacle without a story to support it.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor fans of extreme gore, Terrifier 3 might meet expectations, but even for them, the lack of coherence in the script and the absence of a solid plot might prove frustrating. What could have been an opportunity to take the franchise to new levels of depth and creativity ends up being an exercise in shock for shock’s sake.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn conclusion, Terrifier 3 gets lost in its own excess, leaving viewers with an empty, exhausting experience that, while visually impactful, lacks narrative purpose.'],\n",
       " [\"Well, one off from two of this year's most expected movies alongside 'The Battle of Five Armies'. Like all the Chris Nolan fans, I was equally excited to see the movie on the opening day opening show. But I slightly disappointed that it was not a digital 3D film. I agree, this science-fiction was more dramatized than usual space travel stories does with an adventure-thriller. Almost a 3 hour long stretch movie did not waste much time to take us to the core of the story. Get prepared for this extremely rare voyage into the space with a logical explanation for everything you see on the screen. Well done research for the most matured and intelligent writing. All the credit must go to Nolan brothers. A good sign from Jonathan Nolan, who can make big in the entertainment industry in a future like his brother.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs we know many had liked 'Inception', to me that was a simple multi-layered action movie, that's all. But the same stuffs that used in this film makes sense. In fact, you have to have a little knowledge over how the universe works, so then it will be easy to catch the scene and situations while watching the movie. Totally like a documentary style concept, but with the additional stuffs like characters and its emotions add flavor that gives a movie look. An educational movie, though it also can work for those who wants just entertainment. Only the slow movie pace would test their patience.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt all begins like Shyamalan's 'Signs' movie with a family living surrounded by corn field. Then switches to 'The Astronaut Farmer' and going through 'Gravity', finally meets the 'Inception'. It was just a reference to call the movie setting that brings constant change for every half an hour. Like the opening scene and the end scene had over a 100 years difference.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs I earlier said it was the story of a family alongside the future of humankind and decoding universal mysteries through travelling in space and time. This movie would a reasonable for those who thought '2001: A Space Odyssey' is a boring piece, Cleverly written cinematic piece especially for science geeks. I don't know how perfect the movie to the actual present astrophysics, but will justify for the common people's capacity of understanding with an encourageable amount of commercial elements in it to entertain as well.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first three quarters of the movie was well made. It puts me in a unblinkable position like a story was narrated by Brian Cox in a television series. Like I said, lots of astrophysics involved in it, but strangely human emotions were also exhibited equally that I never expected one from Nolan film. It was not an ordinary sentiment, but was strong enough to make a man cry for happy and sad situations in the movie. I liked science and emotion coming together. In fact, it saved the movie, otherwise it would have been a science documentary straight from NASA production through Nolan direction.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are many surprise elements in the movie and of course there is a twist at the end. We can call it a series of twists like the layers. Compared to last quarter of the movie to the rest, it completely detaches which opens broadly to the different directions. And that happens so fast rushing towards the other end. Which give an impression of the movie 'Inception'. In a perfect way to say the first 75% was 'The Tree of Life' and the remains are 'Inception'.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘‘This world's a treasure,\\r\\nbut it's been telling us to leave for a while now.’’\\r\\n\\r\\nAll the actors were so good. Matthew McConaughey steals the show as he dominates the majority of the screen space in the story presentation. There's no ruling out the fine performance executions from Anne Hathaway and the young star from the Twilight movie, Mackenzie Foy. The remaining cast was having less scope which were like the guest appearances that was widened a little broader, but was perfectly fitted for the story. Especially Matt Damon's was the crucial one.\\r\\n\\r\\nRemember the movie 'Contact', a lovely movie, which was ruined by its fictional ending. Something like that happened in this film as well. The story was initiated with a realistic approach with actual scientific contents as per the present understanding about the universe. But the end was let me down with the layered contents that kind of impossible to agree with it. As a cinematic theme it worked, yeah, a good solution for this wonderfully written story. We know that the time can't run backwards, so that's the trouble.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnyway, this movie defines in a new way, I mean scientifically the existence of ghost. It was not a horror movie, but I liked supernatural force that merged with this science fiction theme. That explains and gives vast ideas to expand our physics beyond something and somewhere yet to reach. Hats off to the director, because he was not thinking of making money here. His idea was to implement what the humans are understood so far about the cosmos. And he very nicely transformed those into the silver screen with the blend of human emotions. In my opinion, this will replace '2001: A Space Odyssey' for sometime till another one make this way.\\r\\n\\r\\nI could have not asked a better space travel drama than this, especially when I heard Nolan doing a science-fiction I believed he gonna rock it. He was so true to the science and the human feelings in this film. If you had seen enough movies before like this one, you can recall your memories like the Tom Hanks parts from 'Cloud Atlas'. But still independently stands strong and falls in a never seen before category.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘‘Maybe we've spent too long\\r\\ntrying to figure all this out with theory.’’\\r\\n\\r\\nThe end scene leaves a hint of a possible sequel. I would be happy if that happen in a near future, but definitely that would be a completely different cinema as per how this one ended. I know his fans want that to happen and so am I.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe visuals were not that great, but simply very good. To see those in digital 3D would have given us a different experience, sadly Nolan was not in favor of that technology. Hoping this movie would get as many as the Oscars nod. Especially not getting into the best motion picture shortlist would be a shame. Like I said I'm no one fan, I just love watching everyone's every movie. I would have went to see it again if it was converted into digital 3D, since I'm modern tech geek when it comes to the films.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt will become a talk of the week, perhaps month all over the world, so don't leave behind when your friends talk about it. What I gonna say is it is a must see asap if you are a movie fanatic like me otherwise Nolan movies does not need anyone's recommendation because his movies usually sell itself like the hot samosa.\",\n",
       "  \"People seem to think that if you enjoy a Christopher Nolan movie, you are a fanboy and the film couldn't really be that good. That is not true. He has never made a bad movie, Insomnia is probably his worst and it is still an excellent movie. \\r\\nInterstellar is up there in his top 3, with The Dark Knight being number 1 and Inception in number 2. I don't think he will ever make a better movie than The Dark Knight, it is without a doubt a masterpiece of cinema in my opinion. It can be enjoyed on so many levels.\\r\\nI remember seeing Interstellar in the movie theater and being on the edge of my seat the whole time. It was breathtaking but the end left me confused so i walked out disappointed. \\r\\nSince then i have watched it many times but it only took a second viewing to realize what a great ending it is and here is why. How many people discuss the end, was the wormhole open or closed for him to make it to Brand, what happens next, is there a sequel. I discuss this with people who hate the movie and the debate will still last a good 30 minutes if not more without getting heated. It is a wonderful story told through the eyes of a genius film maker who deserves more than he receives, an oscar would be nice start.\\r\\nI read hat his next movie is to be released in July 2017, I can't wait to find out everything about it like i have since he began.\\r\\nIf you're unsure about Christopher Nolan, watch his career from the beginning starting with Doodlebug.\",\n",
       "  \"Another grandiloquent movie from Christoper Nolan.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe cast is good, and McConaughey performs a role made for himself. The photography is very nice but the movie commits all the same mistakes than previous Nolan's movies. I think mistakes but it may be that they are the points Nolan fans enjoy the most ...\\r\\n\\r\\n* The story makes you believe it is a realy deeply thought plot but, in the end, it has so basic mistakes and stupidities that make it nonsensical.\\r\\n* There is a general ambience of every moment being epic; deep, solemn and smart dialogues but, at some point our highly trained engineer and pilot behaves really stupidly.\\r\\n* To keep the mentioned constant feeling of being in an epic moment, Nolan uses a thumping and insistent soundtrack. As it is not a moment, but a 3h movie, it is really tiresome.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll in all, the movie is OK but you can only think this is a great movie if you are a real Nolan fan.\",\n",
       "  '\"Man kind was born on earth, it was never meant to die here.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIT has been two days since I watched it and I still can\\'t get it out of my head. I can safely say that it has been a long LONG time since a movie had this much effect on me after watching it. And the only thing I can think of now is to somehow Re-Watch it again.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis movie was surprisingly different from Christopher Nolan\\'s recent works because they had been great cinematic entertainment pieces catered to a wider audience with a blockbuster approach, this certainly didn\\'t felt like that and hence the polarizing response it got. It is an ambitious project that is not meant to merely entertain, walk into it knowing that. I\\'ll say this though, If it works for you, you\\'ll be in heaven.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe premise of the movie is that Earth is no longer capable of supporting humans on it, we must find a new home to avoid extinction. This scenario is told from a very personal perspective and not from a Global scale like some sort of apocalyptic catastrophe disaster film. At the core of the movie is the Father-Daughter relationship. The movie takes its sweet time to develop it too.\\r\\n\\r\\nMathew McConaughey, not surprisingly, gives an amazing performance as the main lead. He really carries the film, some scenes were very emotional due to his great performance. The rest of the cast does a great job as well, especially the Daughter played by Meckenzie Foy. The One character that I never expected to be great was the robot TARS. He also acted as the source of the humor in the movie, well executed, timely and grounded.\\r\\n\\r\\nInterstellar tackles a lot of themes, Survival, Humankind, Love, Time etc, out of which \\'Time\\' had the biggest impact on me. With relativity being a big part in the film, the whole sequence about it just struck me very deeply and I found new respect for Time. I\\'m actually at a loss of words to describe it. Also, there is a lot science in it so it can be confusing for many and in Nolan\\'s tradition, it also has twists and mind numbing ending, where the more you think about it, the more numbing it gets.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe visuals of this movie are breathtaking. Great cinematography and CGI. The depiction of wormholes and blackholes and other space entities were the best I have ever seen. They just suck you into the movie. Along with that, you get to listen to one of Hans Zimmer\\'s best scores. The score not only felt personal, going perfectly with the movie, but also different from his recent works. There were times where combination of epic photography and soundtrack made the scenes timeless, like I was completely sucked into it and didn\\'t had a clue about my surroundings. I didn\\'t want those scenes to end.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlas, the movie was not perfect. My biggest gripe with it is that the pacing and editing was off at times. Some scenes dragged on while others were cut far shorter. The beautiful views of space could have definitely benefited from a few seconds longer onscreen time. Also, I wished there was more space exploration in it.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith all the remakes, rehashes, reboots and sequels we are getting in these times, it is great to see original gems like these. This movie is definitely one of this year\\'s best, one of Nolan\\'s best work and one of the best movie I have seen in recent years.\\r\\n\\r\\n9.5/10',\n",
       "  \"This was my most anticipated film of 2014, and I was not disappointed. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe story was slightly difficult to follow on the first watch, but that was to be expected in a film dealing with complicated fields such as astrophysics and time dilation. Many didn't find its overall message - that love is the most powerful force in the universe which transcends space and time - to be very appealing, but I thought it was an interesting take on special relativity and how two people can be bound by a common feeling, even when they're in different parts of the universe at different times. I also thought the acting was believable, for the most part, and I didn't think anyone was miscast. I enjoyed the surprise appearance from a certain famous actor about halfway through.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut what really blew me away were the visuals and the soundtrack. I believe it was Quentin Tarantino who once said movies and music go hand in hand; that a moving image complimented by the right piece of music can create art. Well, the visuals in this film, which took my breath away, and the score, which perfectly captured the 'feel' of the cosmos and all its wonder, proved him right. I think this was Hans Zimmer's best work yet, and although I'm not Christopher Nolan's biggest fan, I will continue to follow his work if he can pull off more movies like this. \\r\\n\\r\\nMy only regret was not seeing this film in IMAX.\\r\\n\\r\\n10/10\",\n",

The story is not very good, the science is ludicrous and the visuals not all that impressive. Maybe the latter would be better in a big theater (I watched this on my home cinema system which has a relatively large screen by European standards) but I am not really sure about that either.\\r\\n\\r\\nBe warned that the rest of this review might contain a spoiler or two.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe movie starts of with the usual “I told you so” wet dream of the green fanatics on a dying Earth so it is off to a depressing start right away. That is an overused concept today as far as I am concerned. Then they pour it on with a school official claiming that he Apollo missions and moon landings never happened. What the f…? If they wanted to depress the audience right from the start they succeeded, at least with this audience.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe story proceeds with our heroes finding these gravity waves in the sand and by a huge stretch of imagination decrypts them to mean coordinates which leads them to the secret NASA base. Once there Cooper is told that he is their best choice of pilot for a “save the human race” mission through a wormhole. Yeah, right! This guy was former NASA. His whereabouts could hardly been unknown to them. If he was their best choice why would they entrust a mission to save the human race to someone else until he stumbled onto their door? Typical Hollywood nonsense!\\r\\n\\r\\nThe movie is full of this kind of rubbish. Romilly wastes 23 years of his life doing pretty much nothing except deciding not to go into the sleep capsule. The supposedly highly trained and vetted professor that they do find turns out to be a psychopath as well as and idiot almost blowing up the ship when trying to proceed with a docking that all the systems tells him have not succeeded. Then they proceed to dock with the main ship and stop its spin as well as bring it out of orbit around a planet with the shuttles engines. That is one hell of a powerful shuttle not to mention the strength of the docking mechanism! This just goes on. When someone is not doing something illogical or stupid (or both) they sit around talking, philosophizing and dragging the movie forward at snails pace. 169 minutes is way too much for this movie.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe movie ends up in one big time travel mess (okay they do not travel in time, just sends messages through time but still…) during a bunch of psychedelic scenes while traveling through the back hole. Science? Not so much. And what about this totally ludicrous massively illogical and inefficient robot design?\\r\\n\\r\\nThe one good thing I can say about this movie is that the performance of most of the actors, especially Matthew McConaughey, are quite good.

There is some visually pleasing cinematography too, including Saturn, the curvature of spacetime or majestic black hole, which is really satisfying. Some scenes are loud and thrilling, but some moments are so quiet, that you actually think, you are in space!\\r\\nThe movie is long but gripping. The plot, although it's complicated, is told easily and understandably.

Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway and Jessica Chastain are the only character\\'s that to me were interesting and I cared for them, but the rest of the character\\'s I didn\\'t really care for.\\r\\n\\r\\nOverall Interstellar is a mind-blowing movie with fantastic visual\\'s, interesting story line and the movie will keep you interested till the end.',\n",

Leaving a seriously narked daughter behind, he accepts the mission and together with the daughter of \"Brand\" (Anne Hathaway) their perilous trek begins. This is a more solid sci-fi adventure from Christopher Nolan. Though it features doses of his usual time bending scenarios, for the most part it is an exciting action film with mishaps a-plenty as their mission sees danger at just about every junction. There is a decent chemistry between Hathaway and McConaughey allowing the characters to develop with some depth that helps to draw us into to their efforts. The visual effects are superb, it has TARS - a rather clunkily designed robot that proves a whizz when running and rescuing, and the ending has something of the Escher drawing to it. The narrative can be thought provoking offering quite an interesting series of choices, especially when Matt Damon (\"Mann\") joins the story and begins to challenge their approach to just what \"humanity\" might actually be! A host of celebrated co-stars prop it up well. John Lithgow is effective as the patriarch of the family and Casey Affleck and Wes Bentley help diffuse the intensity of the principal relationship as the space-bound menace gradually accumulates.

       "  '\"Interstellar\" is easily one of the best movies I’ve ever watched, definitely in my top 5 of all time. It’s a masterpiece that feels like every scene matters. Each moment carries an important message, whether it’s about love, sacrifice, or the endless curiosity of humans to explore the unknown. It’s not just a movie, it’s an experience.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe performances by the actors were amazing. Matthew McConaughey as Cooper really made me feel every bit of his emotions; his love for his kids, his struggle, and his determination to save humanity. Anne Hathaway also nailed her role, and Jessica Chastain, as adult Murph, was just perfect. Even the smaller roles added so much depth to the movie. It felt like everyone gave their absolute best.\\r\\n\\r\\nChristopher Nolan’s direction? Flawless. You can see how much thought and care he put into every part of the movie. The production was top-notch, and the visuals of space were breathtaking. Even the robots, TARS and CASE, felt real and practical, not just fancy CGI. Fun fact: those robots were real models controlled by an actor, which is crazy to think about! The black hole, Gargantua, was also scientifically accurate thanks to physicist Kip Thorne, and it looked stunning on screen.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe soundtrack by Hans Zimmer deserves its own shoutout. The way he used the church organ and ticking sounds created a mood that’s unforgettable. It felt like the music was alive and part of the story, pulling me deeper into every scene.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe movie also taught me things. I love how it’s based on real science, like time dilation and wormholes, but it doesn’t feel boring or like a science lesson. Instead, it made me curious and left me thinking long after it ended.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne thing that stood out for me is how the movie shows the power of love and connection. The relationship between Cooper and his daughter Murph was the heart of the story for me. It reminded me that even in the vastness of space, what truly matters are the people we care about.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Interstellar\" isn’t just about saving the world; it’s about what it means to be human. Watching it makes you think about big questions: Why are we here? What’s our purpose? And how far are we willing to go for the ones we love? It’s rare to find a movie that’s this entertaining, emotional, and thought-provoking all at the same time.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is the kind of movie I could watch over and over again and still find new details to appreciate. It’s honestly hard to put into words how much I love it, but if you’ve seen it, you know what I mean. It’s a masterpiece that stays with you.'],\n",

The plot is idiotic to say the least and the same can be said for everything done by the characters.\\r\\n\\r\\nI know movies can take artistic freedoms some times, but when you have among other equally brain dead moments scenes of gunshots in airport bathrooms, inside airplanes and stabbings in the middle of busy airport lobbies and nobody somehow magically notices this nor is at all worried about this or the TSA agent acting all erratically you are acting a bit too much of the viewer. I have to say I did have to laugh at how surreal and stupid the scene is where the lead's girlfriend is talking to him in the middle of a airport lobby and a big old red dot appears smack on her forehead and nobody notices anything.\\r\\n\\r\\nTrust me you don't want to watch this movie. 2024 has been a terrible year for movies, but Carry-on is my nomination for the worst movie of 2024 with zero redeeming factors.\",\n",
       "  '**Stay away, you have been warned!**\\r\\n\\r\\nThis movie was so absurd that I felt compelled to write this review to warn others.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom start to finish, it’s a series of implausible and downright ridiculous events. The portrayal of airport security in particular is laughably unrealistic. I hardly know where to begin, but here are just a few examples: there’s a gunfire incident in the airport bathroom that somehow goes unnoticed, a TSA officer is stabbed in a public area with no reaction from anyone, and a random guy drives his van around the airport like it’s his personal property. These are just a few of the endless, nonsensical scenes that will leave you shaking your head in disbelief.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo make matters worse, the protagonist makes one frustratingly foolish decision after another, leaving you more annoyed than invested. It’s almost as if the movie is determined to test your patience at every turn.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is, without a doubt, the dumbest movie of the year. It doesn’t deserve more than 1 star, and I’m baffled that it has a rating above 6—it’s a joke. Save yourself the frustration and skip this one.',\n",

       "  'In my last review (which you can find on my Letterboxd), I said _The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe_ was a \"nearly perfect film.\" Well, I am here to say that with this viewing, to me, it is a perfect film. \\r\\n\\r\\nI used to always think this film was a sort of step below LOTR, and, while LOTR is indeed a masterpiece of cinema, I don\\'t regard this film as lesser.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe movie is just pure magic! Every aspect of the movie (minus the CGI – which doesn\\'t really hold up [except for Aslan] but is still serviceable) is even better with age! And I find myself moved emotionally by more things this time than I ever have watching this film.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe score by Harry Gregson-Williams is just phenomenal. Especially \"The Battle\" – that goes without saying. But this time, part of the magic and nostalgia I was struck by was the musical piece that sounds like it\\'s a song. The one that plays while the train is leaving London. (I found out it\\'s actually about halfway into the track \"Evacuating London.\") That magical song, combined with the great camera work by Donald M. McAlpine and the appearance of the movie title makes for feelings of peak nostalgia and magic for me.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlso, this film has one of the best opening scenes of all time. When Netflix (finally) remakes the films, I don\\'t know how they can top this opening. \\r\\n– In fact, that\\'s another thing about this movie: There are so many things that I don\\'t think any remake could top. Liam Neeson as Aslan, Tilda Swinton as Jadis, the White Witch, and James McAvoy as Tumnus. – Oh, and, though he\\'s not in the book, the centaur, Oreius (played by Patrick Kake), is so cool! Can\\'t top that.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlso, the costuming is excellent – especially for the White Witch – and the gryphons are so cool! The sound design on their shriek gives me chills (in a good way).\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd I can\\'t go without saying that this is also an emotional story because of what the story represents, the symbolism of the story.\\r\\nEdmund represents us – represents me, a sinner. I who have walked in rebellion against God, and who am by nature opposed to God. And as such, I deserve the wrath of God, punishment that He would be fully just to give me. But Aslan represents Jesus Christ. Like Aslan sacrificed himself for Edmund, dying the death he should have died, Jesus sacrificed Himself in our stead, taking upon Himself the wrath of God we deserved, so that “if [we] confess with [our] mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in [our] heart that God raised Him from the dead, [we] will be saved” (Romans 10:9), we “will not perish but have eternal life” (from John 3:16), and as a result of that faith, “we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ” (from Romans 5:1).\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u202d\\u202dEphesians\\u202c \\u202d2:1\\u202d-\\u202c10\\u202c\\r\\n\\r\\n> “[1] And you were dead in the trespasses and sins [2] in which you once walked, following the course of this world, following the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that is now at work in the sons of disobedience— [3] among whom we all once lived in the passions of our flesh, carrying out the desires of the body and the mind, and were by nature children of wrath, like the rest of mankind. [4] But God, being rich in mercy, because of the great love with which He loved us, [5] even when we were dead in our trespasses, made us alive together with Christ—by grace you have been saved— [6] and raised us up with Him and seated us with Him in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus, [7] so that in the coming ages He might show the immeasurable riches of His grace in kindness toward us in Christ Jesus. [8] For by grace you have been saved through faith. And this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God, [9] not a result of works, so that no one may boast.

       "  'CS Lewis certainly had one heck of an imagination and it is rarely better exemplified than in this lovely fantasy adventure. Four wartime siblings are evacuated from London to stay with the reclusive \"Professor Kirke\" (Jim Broadbent) in the relative safety of the English countryside. Once they get there, the housekeeper \"Mrs. Macready\" (Elizabeth Hawthorne) makes it quite clear that they are to be seen and not heard! Boredom sets in and thus a game of hide and seek seems sensible. \"Lucy\" takes refuge in an old wardrobe - a wardrobe that has a secret! Much to her astonishment, she finds herself in a snowy land with a single streetlamp and there meets \"Mr. Tumnus\" (James McAvoy) - a scarf-clad faun. She returns to her brothers and sister and after some convincing, they join her in the wardrobe and all discover the delights and dangers of \"Narnia\" meeting loads of new friends and a couple of not so nice wolves, too! This is the first of the adventures of the \"Pevensie\" children in this mysterious land where animals can talk and winter is perpetual under the control of the villainous \"White Witch\" (Tilda Swinton). They align with \"Aslan\" the all powerful lion (voiced by Liam Neeson) and have a battle royal to free the kingdom from her icy grip. The CGI isn\\'t, to be honest, great. Indeed, some of the effects are a bit cheap and cheerful for 2005; but the story, settings and characterisations are great - as is Harry Gregson-Williams\\' eerie and gentle score.',\n",

It still gets me every time, especially the lullaby scene with Mr. Tumnus, played beautifully by James McAvoy, who is one of my favorite actors. Liam Neeson’s voice as Aslan is inspiring and adds so much gravitas to the character. But for me, the standout is Tilda Swinton as the White Witch. Her performance is chilling and commanding, making her one of the most memorable parts of the movie.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe production is top-notch. The visuals are stunning, especially considering it was released in 2005, and they mostly hold up well even now. The costumes and set design are fantastic, capturing the magical and otherworldly feel of Narnia. The soundtrack is another highlight, adding emotional depth to key moments and making the experience even more immersive.\\r\\n\\r\\nBased on the beloved novel by C.S. Lewis, the film does a good job of sticking to the important plot points while making the story accessible to a new generation. Of course, no adaptation is perfect, but this one stands on its own as a great piece of fantasy storytelling. It’s not just a movie; it’s a journey into a world full of magic, courage, and redemption.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis movie also feels like the perfect pick for the holiday season. It has that warmth and wonder that makes it ideal to watch with family at Christmas. The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe remains a classic, and I can’t recommend it enough for anyone who wants to experience a bit of magic'],\n",

You get the drift. Many of the robots don\\'t have the cogs in their chests necessary to do any transforming, and that includes the lively \"Orion Pax\", his pal \"D-16\" and their feisty supervisor \"Elita-1\", but when a series of incidents occur that sees them escape from their mine onto the forbidden surface they discover an whole new truth that questions not just the history that\\'s been drummed into them, but the very integrity of their leadership.

       " ['Pursuing the American Dream is an ambition of almost every immigrant who manages to make it to this country’s shores. Its realization can take many forms, too, depending on one’s circumstances. But, as many new arrivals discover for themselves, there’s no guarantee of success (or, at the very least, they may find that the journey can be more problematic than anticipated). One such story that provides the focus for this optimistic undertaking is the latest offering from writer-director Brady Corbet. The film follows the odyssey of László Tóth (Adrien Brody), a fictional Jewish Hungarian architect who flees Europe in 1947 after being interred in a concentration camp during World War II. He initially struggles to assimilate, to re-establish his career, and to find a way to bring his wife, Erzsebét (Felicity Jones), to America. But, despite these sundry challenges, his fortunes change drastically when he’s commissioned to design a high-profile mixed use community center with the generous support of a wealthy and powerful benefactor, a capricious, enigmatic industrialist (Guy Pearce) whose many impulsive, emotionally charged whims provide László with a firsthand introduction to the many possibilities and pitfalls tied to that elusive American Dream. In telling this story, the filmmaker explores the ups and downs associated with these themes, as well as an array of additional diverse story threads involving the protagonist’s professional pursuits and personal life. These combined elements make for an engaging and intriguing tale, even if some of the story arcs and character traits are unevenly developed. That sometimes includes the nature of László himself, which is somewhat perplexing given the production’s hefty 3:35:00 runtime (with an included intermission), a duration that should provide ample time for the picture to sufficiently flesh out its core narrative elements and character attributes. That shortcoming aside, though, “The Brutalist” has myriad strengths to its credit, including the fine performances of Pearce, Jones, Golden Globe Award winner Brody and a host of capable supporting players, along with its superb cinematography, stirring original score, and ably sustained pacing (quite a commendable feat for a film of this length). Admittedly, this offering’s solid opening act is far superior to its back half, which tends to sag at times as it wears on, but, on balance, this Golden Globe winner for best drama and best director generally holds up well. In an awards season that has had more than its share of dismal disappointments, it’s heartening to finally find a release that comes closer to approaching the standards that a film should embody to merit the kinds of accolades and attention such honorees truly deserve. It may not be perfect, but it’s a far sight better than many of its other 2024 cinematic peers.',\n",
       "  'Did this really need to be 3½ hours long? Well, no - I don\\'t think so. As far as it goes, though, it features a stunning performance from Adrien Brody as fictional Hungarian architect \"Tóth\" who has manages to survive some torrid wartime experiences in Europe and make it to New York. He has family there, and that\\'s the conduit to a meeting with the wealthy \"Van Buren\" (Guy Pearce) who decides that he wants him to design a public utility building - think Hearst Castle only without any style or shape to it. Indeed the title could very well be applied to his fascist style of bleak and angular artistry, but his new benefactor is prepared to commit £850,000 to the project so he\\'s delighted. That\\'s clearly to the chagrin  of \"Harry\" (How Alwyn) whose role here is that of a meddlesome provoker as he he constantly tries to intervene between the architect and his father. \"Van Buren\" senior also manages to facilitate his repatriation with wife (Felicity Jones) and her niece \"Zsófia\" (Raffey Cassidy) but that doesn\\'t quite go to plan either, and soon seems to further pile on the increasing misery for a \"Tóth\" who is treading on eggshells on all fronts now as he tries to build his charm-free edifice. The centrepiece of this is to be an altar stone, and for that he and his boss travel to the mountains of Carrara, rarely seen in film since Charlton Heston saw the ceiling of the Sistine in the clouds there. Here something shocking happens that ultimately changes the whole dynamic of that relationship and of the film itself. It\\'s this last twenty minutes that I felt saw the wheels come off. The thrust of the story throughout appears to emphasise the man and his family as outsiders. As them being a means to an end and little better than a commodity to be used and abused as one of the \"Van Buren\" men see fit, but the drunken violence that concludes the story seems excessively designed to disgust for the sake to it. Why? I didn\\'t get it, nor the consequent denouement. It\\'s also interesting that much is being made of the VistaVision angle. That which put so many from Humphrey Bogart to John Wayne on the big screen decades ago now appears to have been \"rediscovered\" as if it were revelatory. Well it might help the photography, but not the story - and that begins to run out steam before the unnecessary (from a plot perspective) intermission. Part one offers a compelling look at obsession and the odious nature of patronage and hypocrisy. Part two isn\\'t nearly so good, is more soapy and far less substantial - there is plenty going on but none of the threads really get the attention they need to make them interesting, or to ant them together cohesively. Brady Corbet has one hell of an imagination but perhaps this needed a more objective, and judicious, hand at the tiller. It\\'s good, but it\\'s not anything like as good as it\\'s being hyped up to be. A big screen is essential, though. It will look depressingly ordinary on the television.'],\n",

It has a serviceable story, that reminds me a little of \"A Quiet Place\" from 2018. The core premise is not quite the same but the monster effects are similar, as is the rural setting. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe tension is ratcheted up nicely as the story progresses. As is always the case with what is essentially a survivalist horror, we know the creatures are going to get in but what happens next is, of course, the interesting part. Along the way we get to know the key characters, including Cages father figure. His effective absence part way through film and his return near the end, is a little disappointing but given this film has a coming of age component, its understandable. \\r\\n\\r\\nActing is decent throughout and you can certainly relate to the plight of Cages little ad-hoc family. The creature effects work well enough too but somehow, they are just not all that creepy or especially menacing. This tends to rob the film of a real post apocalyptic horror vibe. I think revealing exactly what they are, early on, was a mistake too that took away any reveal/jump scare potential, from the film. \\r\\n\\r\\nAll that said, Arcadian is in most respects a worthwhile watch that you should consider adding to your horror/thriller inventory. Definitely worth a look.',\n",

No, I didn\\'t say it was original, but it\\'s quite well paced as the loved-up \"Thomas\" manages to get a bit too close to these nocturnal monsters which causes his father to get injured and requires \"Joseph\" - the brains of the family (who reminded me the entire time of Dan Radcliffe) to come up with some clever ruses to keep the whole lot of them alive. Cage barely features which is no bad thing here as the two boys and girlfriend \"Charlotte\" (Sadle Soverall) make a perfectly good job of keeping the thing moving along quickly and quite entertainingly for and hour and an half. The visual effects aren\\'t the best, but the claustrophobic settings; the regular axe-wielding; a fair bit of burrowing and a the help of a chest freezer work fine.

       "  \"As a long-time fan of Nic Cage, I went into Arcadian with high expectations. The trailer was intriguing, hinting at a familiar story with potential for new and exciting directions. However, the film felt like two different movies in one. While I enjoyed both aspects separately, they didn't blend well together.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe film starts with a grounded, realistic tone that sets up an engaging story. Nic Cage delivers a solid performance, immersing himself in a character that is both relatable and compelling. However, the narrative takes a sharp turn into absurdist territory, introducing elements that feel out of place in the established world. For example, the grounded scenes where Cage's character navigates personal challenges are suddenly juxtaposed with bizarre, otherworldly events that disrupt the film's coherence.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe grounded part of the story focuses on Cage's character dealing with real-world issues, offering a nuanced exploration of his psyche. This segment is filled with strong character development and emotional depth. In contrast, the absurdist elements, featuring creatures that seem to belong in a different genre, clash with the film's initial tone. \\r\\n\\r\\nWhile it's possible to successfully combine grounded and absurdist elements in a film, Arcadian struggles to achieve this balance. The creatures introduced do not fit seamlessly into the world we are shown, leaving many questions unanswered. The lack of cohesion between the two parts of the story makes it difficult for the audience to stay engaged. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe film raises intriguing questions about the nature of reality and perception but fails to provide satisfying answers or connections between the disparate elements.\\r\\n\\r\\nDespite its narrative shortcomings, Arcadian boasts solid acting and impressive cinematography. Nic Cage's performance is a highlight, bringing intensity and authenticity to his role. The cinematography enhances the film's atmosphere, capturing both the grounded and surreal elements with skill. \\r\\n\\r\\nArcadian is a film with strong individual components that fail to coalesce into a unified whole. The acting and cinematography are commendable, but the disjointed narrative undermines the film's potential. To improve, a more seamless integration of the grounded and absurdist elements would be necessary, providing clearer connections and answers to the questions posed. Despite its flaws, the film offers moments of intrigue and is worth watching for fans of Nic Cage and experimental cinema.\",\n",

He is now to be an investigator for the state, a stone’s throw from the judiciary, and an important job. He discovers quite quickly, though, that his is really little more than a rubber-stamping position for the prosecutors who are enforcing Iran’s increasingly Draconian laws. His workload is only increased by the evident volume of civil disobedience, and for his own protection he is given a gun. At home, his wife is conscious this new job will heap additional pressure on the family and that it’s more important than ever that they keep their noses clean. Their daughters are going to school and college and are experiencing the horrors inflicted on protestors at first hand. This becomes even more poignant when their friend “Sadaf” (Niousha Akhshi) is caught up with brutal consequences. With “Iman” more disconsolate about the compliant nature of his new job family life becomes strained. Then the gun goes missing. They tear their home apart but no trace. Has he left it somewhere? Has it been stolen? The shame that will be heaped upon him, not to mention the three years in jail, should he not find it. He begins to conclude that the thief must be one of his family, and so resorts to ever more extreme measures to force the culprit to own up. When that takes them all to his home village, things starts to come to an head that tests everyone’s mettle and challenges that which all of them have hitherto cherished. The drama itself is tautly paced and becomes almost visceral as the exasperation and panic sets in amongst parents who realise that nothing is now as it was. It’s also supported by some fairly ghastly UGC from mobile phones depicting the actions of the police as they clamp down on the women who are rebelling against the restrictiveness of what they see as an ever more oppressive theocracy that reduces them to positions of little better than slavery. The plot isn’t without it’s holes, and I found the denouement all a little bit unsatisfactory for a number of reasons, not least what auteur Mohammad Rasoulof allows the character of “Iman” to become, but it’s still a compelling critique of how even the most loving of relationships can come undone when pressure, hatred, fear and mistrust are allowed unfettered into an home that’s embedded within the infrastructure of a corrupt and savagely dogmatic regime.'],\n",

This action immediately earns him the enmity of the now fired captain \"Danglars\" (Patrick Mille) and then just as his joy is to be complete with his marriage to \"Mercedes\" (Anaïs Demoustier) the soldiers arrive and he\\'s implicated in a Napoleonic plot! The prosecutor, \"de Villefort\" (Laurent Lafitte) appears sympathetic and accepts his pleas of innocence, but when his close friend \"Morcef\" (Bastien Bouillon) is called upon to vouch for \"Dantès\" his own envious agenda takes hold and next, our naive young seaman is heading to the solitude of the Chateau D\\'If from which prisoners never escape. As the years of relentless frustration and boredom go by, his only conversation is a regular call from his jailers to see if he\\'s still alive. Then a miracle occurs. Another prisoner has been tunnelling for years and inadvertently breaks through to his cell. It\\'s this man - the Abbé Faria (Pierfrancesco Favino) - who gives him more than a little education as they try to dig their way to the sea wall. It\\'s not to be for both, though, but armed with a knowledge that could change his life for ever, he manages to trick the guards and make it to land. It\\'s now that the story of revenge hots up as we jump forward a few years and are introduced to the eponymous Count. He travels in style, has great wealth and style and is determined to avenge himself on the three men who framed him. As with himself, these men have gone on to great things with his denouncing friend now married to his love, \"Danglars\" owning a great trading fleet and the prosecutor now a powerful state official. \"Dantès\" has used his time well, assembling some allies whose roles in this unfolding drama are gradually revealed to us as politics, greed and jealousy stride to the fore of this classically designed production. The lavish costumes, stately homes and opulence of their lives contrasts well with the poverty and ruin faced by those collaterally damaged by the ambitions of men who cared but for themselves, and for whom our dashing and calculation gazillionaire is gunning. Nimey (who occasionally looked a bit like Kevin Kline here?) delivers that wronged and now Machiavellian characterisation especially well. There are also strong efforts from the younger characters \"Albert\" (Vassili Schneider); \"André\" (Julien De Saint Jean) and \"Haydée\" (Anamaria Vartolomei). It\\'s essentially a thoroughly potent story of revenge, but it\\'s as much about just how that can become a toxic influence that can eat into a man\\'s soul and the challenge for \"Dantès\" and those around him whom he loves - however unwillingly on the surface - is not to become an obsessed demon every bit as ghastly as those he wishes to punish. It\\'s this slow, dripping, evolution that the film delivers enthrallingly as we see this troubled man tread an increasingly conflicted line between love and hate. Revenge is said to be a dish best served cold, but like most things served cold - it doesn\\'t keep for long.',\n",
       "  \"The 2024 reimagining of The Count of Monte Cristo is a cinematic triumph, setting a new benchmark for adaptations of the beloved Dumas classic. Directed by Jacques Bernard, this latest French interpretation is nothing short of spellbinding, with Pierre Niney delivering a portrayal of Edmond Dantès that feels both deeply authentic and timeless. From Dantès’ naive beginnings to his calculated, unrelenting vengeance, Niney embodies the role with a level of intensity and depth that captivates from the very first scene.\\r\\n\\r\\nVisually, the film is breathtaking. The cinematography paints each setting—from the claustrophobic depths of Château d'If to the grandeur of Parisian society—in vivid, atmospheric detail. Every shot feels like a piece of art, masterfully capturing both the story’s drama and its rich historical backdrop. The film’s use of real locations transports viewers to the story’s world, making each moment feel hauntingly real, a rare achievement in period cinema.\\r\\n\\r\\nAdding to the experience is a lush, evocative score that amplifies the film’s emotional power. The music captures Dantès' inner turmoil and triumph with remarkable sensitivity, lending every high-stakes scene an added layer of tension. It’s a soundtrack that will stay with you long after leaving the theater, a perfect companion to Dumas' tale of betrayal and redemption.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe film’s costumes, masks, and makeup are absolutely spectacular. Every detail—whether the intricate designs of Dantès' masquerade attire or the worn expressions on characters weathered by hardship—feels perfectly tailored to the time period. The masks, in particular, add an air of intrigue, shrouding key characters in mystery and creating a rich visual metaphor for the story’s themes of deception and disguise.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt a generous three hours, The Count of Monte Cristo thoroughly explores Dantès' journey, though I found myself wishing it were even longer. An adaptation of this depth and quality could have easily been extended to a two-part epic, much like last year’s exquisite French rendition of The Three Musketeers, with an expanded runtime of four or five hours to fully savor each intricate turn of Dantès' revenge.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn every respect, this 2024 version is a masterpiece and, without a doubt, the definitive Monte Cristo for a modern audience. It balances faithfulness to Dumas' original with bold, cinematic flair, capturing the story's essence in a way that is grand, poignant, and unforgettable. This is a film that will surely stand the test of time.\"],\n",

Well it turns out she is a bit of a miraculous conception from the \"Lockwood\" dynasty that co-founded the original park with \"Hammond\" and is very much on the radar of corporate megalomanic \"Dodgson\" (Campbell Scott) whose company is devising super-engineered locusts to devour great swathes of crops across the United States that are not grown from their own brand of seed. This is where \"Sattler\" (Laura Dern) comes in. She is convinced of this dastardly plan, but must compare the DNA of one from his lab with one they secured in the wild so she can prove it. Her plan enlists the help of old pal \"Grant\" (Sam Neill) and with the help of their intellectual nemesis \"Malcolm\" (a suitably contrarian effort from Jeff Goldblum) they secure an invitation to the company\\'s sanctuary in the Italian Dolomites. Meantime, the young girl is abducted from her wintry home, as is the baby of velociraptor \"Blue\" and so Pratt and Howard have to track them down, and that takes them on some quickly paced, but hardly original, set piece adventures where they meet pilot \"Kayla\" (DeWanda Wise). She chips in to help them in what now reminded me of aspects of the Brendan Fraser \"Mummy\" films, before they also end up in the Italian mountains. Can they team up and thwart the cunning plan? The problem with this, is that there are just way too many characters and too many weakly constructed threads to the story going on. It\\'s all too diffuse and serendipity in the last hour or so just takes far too great a hand in the way the narrative combines and develops. The dinosaur effects are still amazing, but oddly enough I felt them less effective than in previous iterations - there just aren\\'t enough scenes that feature them and when they do, they are just under-used. Pratt is always good value for me, but here he looks out of sorts and hardly features at all; Scott just doesn\\'t cut it as the malevolent baddie (though could his character be the same guy who tried to buy the specimens in the first film?) and Sam Neill relies too much on his bemused facial expressions - indeed his best work on this is pretty much all included in the trailers. It looks great on big screen, includes a few bars now and again from John Williams masterful 1993 score, but for the main part this is a pretty mediocre conclusion to a great franchise with an ending that is rushed and entirely predictable.',\n",

       "  \"<em>'Jurassic World Dominion'</em> is far from perfect, if just about entertaining to watch... kinda.\\r\\n\\r\\nI'm not fully convinced by it but I do think there's enough in there that's worth watching. There are too many characters, even main characters with the original trio and the newer duo both involved equally. With that said, I do like 'em. It's pleasant to see Sam Neill, Laura Dern and Jeff Goldblum, while Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard are a good pairing.\\r\\n\\r\\nStill, I wouldn't say any one character stands out here. They all make their presence known, though I'm struggling to remember any great moments individually - that's due to the aforementioned surplus. The rest of the cast, fwiw, are all fine - Mamoudou Athie sticks out most in that regard.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe run time is overlong, in my opinion. I personally could've done without 30 or so minutes and I wouldn't have felt it was missing anything. The story itself isn't all that fresh, as in I feel like I've seen this sorta thing before (I mean, Biosyn... how creative!), but the barrage of dinosaur-centric action probably just abouts tips it over into a positive rating for yours truly. Could easily be lower, though.\\r\\n\\r\\nI'd love for this to be the end of the Jurassic franchise (is there much more to tell?) but there ain't no way Amblin/Universal are leaving this IP to collect dust, let's be honest.\",\n",
       "  'So after watching the first four movies in this franchise (three of which I had seen more than once, I finally watched this most recent effort. There are similarities and differences between Dominion and the earlier ones.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt held some of the usual elements: a child for us to care when they placed her in danger; the ability of the heroes (even the child) to outrun dinosaurs under a blind panic; walking dinosaur food, also known as bad guys; and references to the original theme park that started it all. They outdid themselves this time - keep an eye out for the Barbasol shaving cream canister.\\r\\n\\r\\nOf course, there are plenty of differences also. Parts of it weren’t even recognizable as part of the franchise. They juggle plot lines around the dinosaurs, the ethics of genetic engineering, a child clone kidnapping, industrial malfeasance, and what for me was the most interesting subplot and most closely tied to the original film: the struggle for humans and dinosaurs to co-exist under the new planetary paradigm. \\r\\n\\r\\nAnother difference is that there are two romances developing throughout the film.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn improvement is the return of characters we know well: Ellie Sattler and Alan Grant are back, and Ian Malcolm is present long enough to get in a few of his witticisms, unlike in the last movie.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo ultimately I found Dominion to be entertaining enough to stick with it, though the aspects that might have been intended to make me think just sort of got in the way.',\n",
       "  '**Not as bad as reviews say, but go in with reasonable expectations.**\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the conclusion of the Jurassic World trilogy, it, unfortunately, had similarities to Rise of Skywalker. A lot of things were going on. Some fun moments. Great nostalgia with the legacy cast. Lots of dino action. But it also felt like they had so much going on that they ran out of time to highlight characters and make us care. I will always love Jurassic Park, so this movie got a little boost in rating because of nostalgia from me.',\n",

Unfortunately that is more or less the only reason to watch this movie.\\r\\n\\r\\nI really do not understand how the Hollywood idiots can decide to spend loads of money on special effects but not bother to get a decent story/script writer? I mean come on, the story of this movie is just another thirteen on a dozen “big companies are bad” story with dinosaurs thrown in.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe story is convoluted to say the least and there is as much logic in it as you would expect from a Hollywood writer hack. Things more or less just happen and the “heroes” fight off one dinosaur attack after another on their way to the bad gay without ever tiring. And why the hell can Hollywood never produce a movie where the “heroes” doesn’t just stare like idiots at something until they are screwed?\\r\\n\\r\\nIdiotic nonsens like being able to train a dinosaur to home in on someone like a heat seeking missile and chase them forever after having pointed a laser marker on them for a couple of seconds is also the usual unintelligent Hollywood nonsense that just ruins a movie for anyone with anything like average intelligence.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey brough back some of the old characters but they do not really help. The mostly act like they cannot wait to get paid and get out of there. Jeff Goldblum is his usual climate cult procelyte. I did not really like him in the first movie and he is even worse in this one. The bad guy totally lacks charisma. The only character I really liked was DeWanda Wise as Kyle Watts.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is really a shame to see another franchise destroyed by today’s Hollywood morons. I’ve been a dinosaur fan since I was a kid and when the first Jurassic Parc came out with real, life like dinosaurs it was just wow. But now, not even the special effects can save this movie.

There are some Indiana Jones elements in the Malta segment and James Bond bits at the technologically advanced lair in the mountains, both of which I appreciate.\\r\\n\\r\\nYet I strangely never bought the characters as real people. They always struck me as actors performing according to a contrived script, which tries too hard to check the diversity boxes.

       "  'Jurassic World Dominion fails to impress as a dinosaur movie, as the plot seems to be a poor choice. The dinosaurs are present but not the main focus, giving the impression that they are only there to extend the franchise. Even the inclusion of Alan Grant seems to be more for nostalgic purposes than contributing to the story. Chris Pratt\\'s character also appears to be underutilized and serves more as a prop rather than a leading character.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe camera work in the movie is particularly shoddy, with cuts from one angle to another creating confusion, especially in fast-paced scenes like the one in Malta. The depiction of Malta in the movie is also disappointing, with the country portrayed as a dirty, third-world Arabic nation covered in desert sand, which is not an accurate representation of the country. The use of Arabic style music in the background also seems out of place and unnecessary.\\r\\n\\r\\nOverall, Jurassic World Dominion seems to be a movie that was made to extend the franchise rather than being a well-planned and executed story. It is disappointing that a franchise that should have stopped by the third installment continues to churn out mediocre movies. Although the movie is not a complete disaster, it falls short of being an enjoyable watch. \\r\\n\\r\\nAdditionally, the length of the movie seems to be excessive, and the dragging plot does not help in holding the audience\\'s attention. The story\\'s predictability adds to the monotony, leaving little to surprise or engage the viewers.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs if to acknowledge the franchise\\'s overreliance on gimmicks and sequels, Ian Malcolm\\'s line, \"Jurassic World?

       " ['Well another super-sized Marvel Comics superhero saga hits the big screen with the selected savior Captain America taking the top billing on the marquee. Thus, the pulsating popcorn pleaser **Captain America: Civil War** arrives on the scene to giddy audiences that have been loyal and fixated on the successful spring of mighty Marvel heroes that have been paraded to viewers throughout the last few years. Thankfully, **Captain America: Civil War** carries on the tradition of spry superhero-studded spectacles that have been glorious and adventurous from the stable of Marvel-based movies guaranteed to win over the enthusiastic hearts of avid comic book fanboys everywhere. Joyously overstuffed and convincingly extensive with a super team armed with crime-fighting excess, **Civil War** seizes the moment to introduce a noteworthy twist: two factions of rescuing superpowers engaging in some explosive in-house fighting led by two of Marvel Comics main standouts in Chris Evans’s Captain America and Robert Downey Jr.’s Iron Man.\\r\\n\\r\\nCo-directors Anthony Russo and Rene Russo were instinctively crafty to link the overly successful Iron Man film franchise to the **Captain America: Civil War** inner circle to ensure an even more treasured toxic atmosphere. Superhero fans will get a thrill of witnessing the extra add-ons concerning other dynamic titans to join the action-packed festivities involving Team Captain America versus Team Iron Man. True, **Civil War** has its share of flaws but that does not take away from this heroes-in-crisis flick demonstrating its ambitious overtones.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo what has caused the bad blood among the great and grand good guys known for protecting the world from evil dominance and destruction? Essentially the theme of collateral damage, the involvement regarding civilian-related deaths and injuries plus the world-wide backlash has created a controversy pitted against The Avengers. Specifically, Captain America (a.k.a. Steve Rogers) and Scarlet Witch/Wanda Maximoff (Elizabeth Olsen)  are responsible for the boisterous battle that caused such negative sensation resulting in political turmoil. Avengers head honcho Iron Man (a.k.a. Tony Stark) is dealing with his own personal regrets in the ill-advised creation of the unpredictable Ultron. The political authority want to hold Iron Man, second-in-command Captain America and the rest of the Avengers accountable for the global devastation that have taking its toll when trying to oversee the potential harm wreaking havoc on humanity.\\r\\n\\r\\nLeading the charge in putting a watchful eye on the labeled reckless Avengers is Secretary of State Thaddeus Ross (William Hurt) that suggests the super group be monitored by the United Nations. Naturally friction develops between the superheroes that either agree with Ross’s UN restriction policies or disagree with being placed under a microscope that threatens to handcuff their free-wheeling heroic duties. All these contrasting beliefs eventually turn into epic back-and-forth confrontations where the raging Avengers are at odds with each other.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor Stark/Iron Man’s stance, he is willing to toe the line and ultimately agree that his crew needs to tone down their tenacious tactics as crime-stoppers. Iron Man’s consciousness, particularly in the case of a disillusioned mother (Alfre Woodward) making him feel guilt-ridden over her son’s death during an intense Battle of Sokovia, is probably the main factor behind his decision to have his team reigned in a bit from the political watchdogs. Siding with Iron Man’s viewpoint are the likes of Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), Vision (Paul Bettany) and War Machine (Don Cheadle). As for Rogers/Captain America, he is not too thrilled being put in check by the intrusive governmental pencil-pushers that want to scrutinize the team’s every move. Standing with Captain America firmly are Falcon (Anthony Mackie) and the aforementioned Scarlet Witch.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn top of Captain America’s current Avengers-oriented strife in his contentious mingling with Iron Man and his ardent backers, he now finds himself trying to defend his old buddy-turned-wanted man Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan) who is accused of killing civilians. Iron Man believes in Winter Soldier’s innocence and goes so far as to help him escape. Yes…Winter Soldier does come with more baggage attached to him–mainly in the form of the menacing Zemo (Daniel Bruhl).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Russos and screenwriters Christopher Marckus and Stephen McFeely (all attached to the previous “Captain America: Winter Soldier”) provide the eyeful visual effects that predictably stimulate and effectively add to the overload of frenzied frolicking in this boisterous blockbuster. Certainly the deepened angst among this bombastic bunch works far more solidly than what was displayed in the stiffened and problematic Batman v. Superman. The notion that the entire globe and its leaders are weary of all the collective chaos at the hands of the Avengers trying to save their hides is a bit ridiculous. Besides, why are not the foes of the Avengers put on the hot coals for the societal ruination? It seems rather counterproductive to chastise the noble superpowers offering the safety of mankind yet the detractors not being grateful for the services that the Avengers bring to the table. It is somewhat convoluted to think that the global community are sour on our heralded heroes or that the heat generated within the walls will completely destroy the Avengers and their colorful, capable colleagues.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe movie’s aptly entitled **Civil War** does invite more punch to the proceedings especially when a who’s who of superhero showstoppers join the feisty fray at hand. The noted inclusion of defiant do-gooders are packed with the likes of Spider-Man (Tom Holland), the retired returnee Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), Ant-Man (Paul Rudd), and nifty newcomer Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman). No doubt Captain America: Civil War is the impish and energizing launch pad for upcoming Marvel-induced movies waiting to make their future distinctive arrival on the big screen. Although Evans’s steady and charismatic Captain America more than holds his own as the solo act billed in the film’s title one cannot overlook Downey’s compelling Iron Man as the reliable source that lifts the profile of Evans’s Masked Wonder. This is indeed a collaborative big score for the glorified costumed cast but special kudos are reserved for Stan’s killing culprit as well as Boseman’s African president assuming the slick and resourceful Black Panther.\\r\\n\\r\\nYeah, **Captain America: Civil War** is true to its frenetic form as revved up entertainment preparing moviegoers for the upcoming summertime sizzle at the box office.

       "  \"**The heroes're divided and so the fans!**\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore watching this I thought what the Avengers are doing here. I believed they got the title wrong. Once I watched it, I'm still the same. Because it did not look like the Captain America's film, he never was dominated, so calling it as his film totally inappropriate. Technically, it is a third Avengers film and well done. I liked it, it was entertaining. But the Civil War means it's nothing a nation's war within, just these super-guys fight for themselves against what kind of administration they want to come under.\\r\\n\\r\\nI think they have heard that people's complaint about blowing up the buildings during reviewing other films by bringing up this one. So they finger pointed those events in this narration and that is one of the reasons for the Civil War to take place. Particularly disturbing the public and loss of many lives when these powerful men fighting the bad guys. The fun part is they are off the street and had a most important confrontation of the film in a deserted airfield. So does it make people who were whining about that be happy?\\r\\n\\r\\nI don't know, but as an entertaining film, it did everything it can give the best for the viewers. Like the title and posters reveal, the heroes are divided here and probably you're going to take a side. Like usual, I'm with the Stark. So if you're like me, then you would feel the annoyance with the opposite team, particularly like Antman and obviously Captain America's rebellious decision. It was like the world versus United States, because only Americans are behind Captain America. Anyway, I did not like dividing the fans and what this film has been a serious damage. I hope the fans won't take it seriously.\\r\\n\\r\\n_8/10_\",\n",
       "  'Recently I have quite liked the Marvel movies that I have watched. Sadly I did not like this movie at all. The only reason that it does not get a zero or one star rating is cool special effects and a few laughs.\\r\\n\\r\\nI want my heroes to be just that, heroes. Unfortunately this movie gets off on the wrong foot right away by not only “incriminating” the Avengers in the eyes of dimwit politicians and putting them on surveillance of a political body but to make matters worse it is the useless black hole of taxpayers money, the\\xa0United Nations, that are supposed to surveil them. That pretty much ruined the movie right away for me.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I though that it could not get any worse it actually does. In true Hollywood fashion the Avengers start to bicker and fight among themselves.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe few redeeming qualities\\xa0of this movie\\xa0is great special effects and a few fun comments that made me laugh from time to time. Even the ending is pretty crappy with the Avengers remaining divided and the main bad guy feeling that he achieved what he wanted.\\r\\n\\r\\nTechnically there is not really anything wrong with the movie. The actors are good, the filming is good and, as I wrote, the special effects are great. The story however is not my cup of tea to put it mildly. I cannot express how much I despised the story in this movie.',\n",

       "  '<b>A long form review originally posted in 2016</b>\\r\\n\\r\\nIt’s commonplace for me to need more than one viewing to really nail down my feelings on a movie, that’s particularly true of MCU, and even more so of this particular film. That all said, here is my initial reaction to _Captain America: Civil War_.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs is often the case, it’s hard to write down too comprehensive a post about a film this early on while remaining totally spoiler-free, so for starters, I’ll just go ahead and ask the thing that was on my mind from about five minutes in to _Civil War_: I want to know how it is that two guys who have a filmography so firmly rooted in sitcoms of all things, manage to direct action this spectacularly? Honestly. It’s insane.\\r\\n\\r\\n_Winter Soldier_ is one of the strongest MCU films in my opinion, and just like that felt mostly like a follow up to both the prior _Captain America_ film and the prior _Avengers_ film, _Civil War_ feels the same, but for the sequels to said films (_Winter Soldier_ and _Age of Ultron_). That said, it might lean a little too far on to the side of _Avengers_-sequel, and a little too light on the _Cap_-sequel. If you had to pick a lead here, it would be Steve Rogers, no mistake, but this does feel like a film painted with a very broad brush of characterisation to be solely a “_Captain America_” movie.\\r\\n\\r\\nConsidering the sheer scope of the piece, it’s amazing that the Russo brothers managed to get the ball rolling on _Civil War_ as well as they did. Even so, there are a couple of roles I felt could have been cut altogether without really impacting the story, and that time could perhaps have been used to serve some underrepresented puzzle pieces. Perhaps both the inclusion in places and lack of inclusion in others is because of plans for future MCU films (though certainly not all instances can use that excuse) but either way, if I’m hunting for flaws, that to some degree is one.\\r\\n\\r\\nI will say, that for all of _Civil War’s_ ups and downs (mostly ups), it is both a worthy entrant into Marvel’s franchise, and perhaps even more importantly, it actually even addresses some of the problems left in _Age of Ultron_. Of course the acting is all above board, the primary action set-piece is just dumbfoundingly fun, and the evolution of the mythology meshes with the universe at large.\\r\\n\\r\\n_Civil War_ may not be my favourite superhero movie, or even my favourite MCU movie (I mean it also might be, I think I need to give it at least another two watches to be sure) but it might just be the best comic book adaptation movie. By that, I don’t mean it accurately portrayed the events of the Marvel “Civil War” event from back 2006, because that’s not even close to true. What I mean is, there are so many instances that manage capture the spirit of what the comics are. And you almost feel like you are watching one unfold before you on the screen. A glorious, squillion dollar, two and a half hour comic book.\\r\\n\\r\\nOh yeah. And the new superheroes introduced in _Civil War_? They’ve got me pretty bloody excited.\\r\\n\\r\\n79%\\r\\n\\r\\n-_Gimly_',\n",

However, the movie works by always being intriguing. Both sides of the conflict are portrayed as equally valid. The exploration of superhero accountability isn\\'t anything new (explored in Watchmen and The Dark Knight), but it\\'s nice to see it incorporated into a grand cinematic universe.

With a powerhouse performance from Sophie Thatcher anchoring it all, this psychological thriller - sprinkled with comedy, romance, and even sci-fi elements - stands out as one of the year\\'s first big surprises.\\r\\n\\r\\nI highly recommend watching it in theaters, as blind as possible.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nRating: B',\n",
       "  \"<em>'Companion'</em> is great! I was actually spoiled on the general gist of this due to the trailers, which I didn't even seek out but despite ignoring them pre-other flicks I still managed to catch what this was about. Happily, it didn't matter as the film lets the cat out fairly quickly.\\r\\n\\r\\nI thought the aforementioned was going to be an issue, even though it is only a 90 minute movie I didn't think at that moment that it was going to have enough in the tank to make the overall movie enjoyable. I was wrong! It's a blast all the way through, there's a pleasant pace to it all.\\r\\n\\r\\nSophie Thatcher is brilliant, her showing is impressive and very convincing. That blood-soaked look is class. The rest of the cast aren't on Thatcher's level but are still positive parts of this film, namely Jack Quaid and Lukas Gage. Thanks to the short run time, this does fly by. Top film!\\r\\n\\r\\nI saw it on the big screen as part of a double bill of sorts with <em>'Hard Truths'</em>. This was the second one and it's a barrel of laughs compared to that Mike Leigh picture. Two films that I would highly recommend, all the same.\",\n",
       "  'We first meet \"Iris\" (Sophie Thatcher) and boyfriend \"Josh\" (Jack Quaid) as they take his self-drive car into the wilderness to meet with some of his friends at the home of millionaire \"Sergey\" (a delightfully over-the-top Rupert Friend). She\\'s not at all keen on his pals. She thinks they look down on her. He tries to reassure her and when they arrive we are introduced to \"Kat\" (Megan Suri) and to loved-up \"Eli\" (Harvey Guillén) and \"Patrick\" (Lukas Gage). She was right, they don\\'t much like her and at this point (for me, anyway) the penny started to drop. The married \"Sergey\" is supposed to be dating \"Kat\" but he\\'s obviously a bit of a Lothario who tries it on with \"Iris\" and, well let\\'s just say he probably wished he hadn\\'t. Thing is, though, there\\'s an whole load of manipulation going on here and it doesn\\'t take \"Iris\", or us, long to realise that nothing is really as it seems. There\\'s a fun chemistry on display here between Thatcher and Quaid and auteur Drew Hancock has crafted an entertaining scenario that avoids the standard cabin-in-the-woods style horror feature. This is a darkly comedic \"careful what you\\'ve wished for\" style of drama that has some decent menace intermingled with a few shades of Dan Stevens in \"Cuckoo\" from last year, too. For me, though, it\\'s the dentally perfect Gage who steals the show proving the very point that true love isn\\'t just skin deep and not everyone keeps their brains in their head! Amidst a tired and formulaic genre, this offers a refreshing change well worth a watch.'],\n",

Meantime, the folks in that city are ruled by a young man \"Ji Fa\" (Yosh Yu) who is enthusiastic and honourable, but not exactly a tactician. Despite his best efforts, the encroaching army arrives at the walls of his city aided by four powerful giants, all equipped with magical talisman. It\\'s during this battle that the lines are truly drawn with a few immortals coming to the aid of the city and with both \"Ji\" and \"Deng\" finding themselves facing a new scenario for which neither are prepared, and which tests their mettle and their loyalties as an angry denouement looms. This is my kind of film: mixing mystery and mythology with superb special effects and a solid story that, though maybe a little predictable towards the end, has all the ingredients of a stylish and engaging acton-adventure. There\\'s imagination a-plenty gone into the production and the characterisations offer us a little more than just the usual linearly flat persona. The green flying ogre works hard for his living here, and the last twenty minutes are lively and colourfully delivered. Might their be a trilogy? It does need a cinema, a big screen makes all the the difference.']]"
